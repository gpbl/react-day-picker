# Changelog

### v8.0.7

- fixed: missing `dropdown_year` CSS class in `YearsDropdown` by @pwolfert in [#1466](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/1466)
- fixed: Maximum update depth exceeded when select the range date by @gpbl in [#1470](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/1470)

### v8.0.6

- fixed: exclude internal modifiers from the `styles` props (`modifiersStyles` should be used instead) by @gpbl in e1449eaa
- fixed: better typings for the props returned by `useInput` by @gpbl in 3ea6728b

In the rare cases you are using an invalid key to the `styles` prop, you may get type errors when upgrading to this release. Just remove the invalid lines from the value of `styles`, as they weren't working anyway. See issue [#1464](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/1464).

### v8.0.5

- changed: use `aria-disabled` instead of `disabled` attribute in buttons ([#1451](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/1451))
- fixed: focus navigation breaks with disabled days ([#1451](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/1451))
