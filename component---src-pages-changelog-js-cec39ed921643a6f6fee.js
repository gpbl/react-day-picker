The next major version should not break existing code but as we are moving [from webpack to rollup](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/milestone/10) we will bump a major for safety :)\n\n### [v7.0.7](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v7.0.7) (2018-01-09)\n\n* (DayPickerInput) Fixed: `daypickerProps.onMonthChange` not being called ([#604](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/604)  by\n  [ah-adarlow](https://github.com/ah-adarlow))\n\n### [v7.0.6](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v7.0.6) (2017-12-31)\n\n* (DayPickerInput) Fixed: focusing behavior when pressing the `TAB` key ([#594](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/594))\n* (DayPickerInput) Fixed: wrong behavior with malformatted dates using the included moment `parseDate` function ([#584](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/584)  by\n  [jbarco](https://github.com/jbarco))\n* Removed duplicated style from CSS ([#591](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/591)  by\n  [nicoffee](https://github.com/nicoffee))\n\n### [v7.0.5](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v7.0.5) (2017-12-03)\n\n* (Typescript) Various fixes to type definitions\n* (DayPickerInput) Fixed: issue parsing dates in January\n* Fixed: Updated month prop not updating the calendar when displaying multiple\n  months ([#580](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/580))\n\n# [v7.0.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v7.0.0) (2017-11-25)\n\n**Breaking changes**\n\n* `enableOutsideDays` prop is now named `showOutsideDays`\n* if you are using `DayPickerInput`, we removed the moment.js dependency and\n  changed how to pass props to the input field (upgrade is easy, see below).\n* if you are using commonjs to import the component, change your code:\n  ```diff\n  - var DayPicker = require('react-day-picker`)\n  + var DayPicker = require('react-day-picker`).default\n  ```\n* if you are using TypeScript and upgrading from `v6.2.1` (see\n  [#533](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/533)), use the default\n  import:\n  ```diff\n  - import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker`;\n  + import DayPicker from 'react-day-picker';\n  ```\n* if you are using a custom CSS, consider that now the calendar table is inside\n  a `div` with a `.DayPicker-Months` CSS class.\n\nIf you find problems while upgrading, please\n[add an issue](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/new), thanks!\n\n**New features**\n\n* Improved layout and style.

If you want to keep using moment.js, your\n  existing code should changes as follows:\n\n  ```diff\n    import DayPicker from 'react-day-picker/DayPickerInput'\n  + import { formatDate, parseDate, } from 'react-day-picker/moment';\n\n    function MyDayPicker() {\n      return (\n        <DayPickerInput\n          placeholder=\"Please choose a date\"\n          format=\"LL\"\n  +       formatDate={formatDate}\n  +       parseDate={parseDate}\n        >\n      );\n    }\n  ```\n\n  See also [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/input-moment).\n\n* You must pass additional props to the input component using the\n  [`inputProps`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#inputProps)\n  prop. _This is not a breaking change if you are just using `placeholder` or\n  `value`_. E.g.:\n  ```diff\n  <DayPickerInput\n     placeholder=\"Type a day\"\n     value={this.state.selectedDay}\n  -  onFocus={myFocusHandler}\n  -  className=\"my-input-css\"\n  +  inputProps={{\n  +   onFocus: myFocusHandler,\n  +   className: 'my-input-css,\n  +  }}\n  />\n  ```\n\n**New features**\n\n* New:\n  [`inputProps`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#inputProps)\n  prop to pass additional props to the input component\n* New:\n  [`parseDate`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#parseDate) and\n  [`formatDate`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#formatDate)\n  props\n* New:\n  [`inputProps`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#inputProps)\n  prop to pass additional props to the input component\n* New:\n  [`overlayComponent`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#overlayComponent)\n  prop: useful to customize the overlay component\n  ([#477](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/477), thanks to\n  [wldcordeiro](https://github.com/wldcordeiro))\n* New: allow to change `numberOfMonths`, `selectedDays` props from\n  `dayPickerProps` ([#513](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/513),\n  [#531](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/531) by\n  [hydrognomik](https://github.com/hydrognomik)). Useful for selecting range of\n  days ([example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/input-from-to)).\n* New:\n  [`showOverlay`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#showOverlay)\n  prop: shows the overlay at the initial rendering (useful for styling)\n* New: [`getInput`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#getInput)\n  and\n  [`getDayPicker`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#getDayPicker)\n  public methods\n\n- Changed: clicking the Today Button will set the input value to today\n  ([#561](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/561))\n- Changed: removed `fixedWeek` prop. Use `dayPickerProps ={{ fixedWeek: true }}`\n  to restore it.\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Fixed: some modifiers were not passed down when using a custom `classNames`\n  ([#517](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/517),\n  [#504](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/504) by\n  [tume](https://github.com/tume))\n* Fixed: focus behavior on Firefox\n  ([#525](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/525) by\n  [martinmosko](https://github.com/martinmosko))\n* Fixed: value not updated when changed in some cases\n  ([#535](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/535))\n* Fixed: localization bug when using multiple languages\n  ([#509](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/509))\n\n---\n\n## [v6.2.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v6.2.0) (2017-10-05)\n\n* Added: TypeScript definitions for DayPickerInput\n  ([#487](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/487) by\n  [adidahiya](https://github.com/adidahiya) and\n  [lpcarignan](https://github.com/lpcarignan))\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Fixed: an issue with React 0.14\n* Fixed: a console warning in React 16\n  ([#493](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/493))\n* `DayPickerInput` Fix an error when `format` is passed as array\n  ([#502](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/502))\n* `DayPickerInput` Fix update when receiving new props\n  ([#495](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/495) by\n  [kradical](https://github.com/kradical))\n\n### [v6.1.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v6.1.1) (2017-09-27)\n\n* Added: React 16 as peer dependency\n  ([#498](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/498) by\n  [brycehill](https://github.com/brycehill))\n* Allow node consumers to remove propTypes for production builds\n  ([#463](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/463) by\n  [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Fixed: disabled interaction in RTL\n  ([#471](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/471) by\n  [edoshor](https://github.com/edoshor))\n\n## [v6.1.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v6.1.0) (2017-07-09)\n\n**Improvements**\n\n* Added new\n  [`onDayMouseDown`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api.html#ondaymousedown)\n  and\n  [`onDayMouseUp`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api.html#ondaymouseup)\n  props ([#445](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/445) by\n  [eldritchideen](https://github.com/eldritchideen))\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Fixed: before/after modifier not working as expected\n  ([#451](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/451))\n* Fixed: changing some props would not update day cells\n  ([#452](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/452) by\n  [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))\n* Fixed: `classNames` may prevent clicking on outside days\n  ([#449](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/449))\n\n### [v6.0.5](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v6.0.5) (2017-07-02)\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Fixed: today button inside a form submits the form\n  ([#443](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/443))\n* Fixed: before/after modifiers not working as expected in some cases\n  ([#442](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/442))\n* `DayPickerInput` Fixed: allow multiple formats in `format` prop\n  ([#439](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/439))\n\n### [v6.0.4](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v6.0.4) (2017-06-26)\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Fixed: next and previous buttons not working via keyboard\n  ([#430](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/430))\n* Fixed: wrapper style cannot be set when using CSS modules\n  ([#432](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/432))\n\n### [v6.0.3](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v6.0.3) (2017-06-22)\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* `DayPickerInput` Call `onDayChange(undefined, {})` when user empties the input\n  field.

There are some possible breaking changes, but they are easy to fix (read\nbelow).\n\n**Breaking changes**\n\n* The container's HTML structure has changed: the interactive element used to\n  focus the calendar has been moved into a wrapper to improve accessibility\n  ([#392](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/392)):\n\n  ```diff\n  <div className=\"DayPicker\">\n  + <div className=\"DayPicker-wrapper\">\n    <!-- rendered stuff here -->\n  + </div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  This is a **breaking change** if you are styling the component using your own\n  CSS or with the `classNames` prop.\n\n  * If you are styling with your own stylesheet, rename your `.DayPicker`\n    selector to `.DayPicker-wrapper`:\n\n  ```diff\n  - .DayPicker {\n  + .DayPicker-wrapper {\n  ```\n\n  * If you are using `classNames` with the `container` prop, rename the\n    `container` className to `wrapper`.\n\n* The container element is now an `inline-block` element.\n\n* When using `fromMonth`/`toMonth` props, navigation buttons now are rendered\n  and hidden via CSS. Before, the buttons were not rendered at all, and it was\n  impossible to style them\n  ([#366](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/366))\n\n  This is a **breaking change** if you are using those props and styling the\n  component using your own CSS or with the `classNames` prop.\n\n  In such cases, the buttons will be always shown even if the previous or the\n  next months are not navigable.\n\n  * If you are styling with your own stylesheet, add a\n    `.DayPicker-NavButton--interactionDisabled` selector to your style with\n    `display: none`.\n  * If you are using `classNames`, add a `navButtonInteractionDisabled` to your\n    `classNames` with `display: none` to hide the buttons.\n\n* Improved rendering performance using `shouldComponentUpdate` and\n  `PureComponent` ([#389](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/389))\n\n  It should not be a breaking change, but if something is not working for you\n  when updating some props please file an issue 🙃\n\n**Improvements**\n\n* Allow `{after, before}` modifiers in the same object\n  ([#354](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/354)). You can now\n  write before/after modifiers such as `disabledDays={ { before: aDate, after:\n  aDate }}`.\n* **DayPickerInput**: added\n  [`clickUnselectsDay`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-input.html#clickunselectsday)\n  prop to unselect and clear the input when clicking on a previously selected\n  day ([#399](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/399))\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Fixed an issue where users were able to focus outside days\n  ([#400](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/400) by\n  [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))\n* Fixed an issue with Internet Explorer 11\n  ([#403](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/403) by\n  [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))\n* **a11y**: fixed a warning `You have an unlabeled element or control.` shown\n  with react-a11y ([#386](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/386))\n* **DayPickerInput**: fixed an issue when updating the `month`'s\n  `dayPickerProps` value\n  ([#380](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/380) by\n  [Yustynn](https://github.com/Yustynn))\n\n**Improvements in the built version**\n\nThese changes applies to the production build from the `lib` dir (e.g. that\nserved from unpkg.com).\n\n* Removed prop types from production build\n  ([#349](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/349))\n* Include `DayPicker.Input` in the built file\n  ([#383](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/383))\n\n  Use `<DayPicker.Input />` to render the input component.\n\n---\n\n### [v5.5.3](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.5.3) (2017-05-25)\n\n* Bugfix for `DayPickerInput`: updated `value` prop now will be reflected in the\n  component's state\n  ([#363](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/363))\n\n## [v5.5.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.5.0) (2017-05-09)\n\n**New DayPickerInput component**\n\nUse the `DayPickerInput` component to render an input field interacting with the\nday picker ([#213](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/213)).\n\nSee [example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/input.html),\n[docs](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/input.html) and\n[API reference](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-input.html).\n\n**New features**\n\n* New\n  [`todayButton`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#todaybutton)\n  prop ([#329](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/329)).\n\n  Use this prop to display a button on the calendar's footer to switch to the\n  current month\n  ([example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/customization-today-button.html)).\n\n* New\n  [`showWeekDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#showweekdays)\n  and\n  [`onWeekClick`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#onweekclick)\n  props ([#304](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/304)).\n\n  Use this props to display and interact with the year's week numbers\n  ([example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/customization-week-numbers.html)).\n\n* New `daysOfWeek`\n  [modifiers type](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/modifiers.html) to match\n  days of the weeks\n  ([#330](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/330)).\n\n  For example, to match Sundays and Mondays:\n\n  ```diff\n  <DayPicker\n    disabledDays={\n  -

    selectedDays={ day => DateUtils.isSameDay(day, this.state.selectedDay)}\n  +     selectedDays={ this.state.selectedDay }\n  />\n  ```\n\n  Read more in the\n  [modifiers documentation](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/modifiers.html).\n\n* **Breaking change** Event handlers signature has changed\n  ([#256](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/256))\n\n  All events handlers like `onDayClick`, `onCaptionClick`, etc. now receive the\n  Syntethic Event as last argument. Thus you must change your event handlers as\n  follow:\n\n  ```diff\n  onDayClick={\n  - (e, day, modifiers) => {\n  + (day, modifiers, e)\n      e.preventDefault();\n      console.log(day);\n      console.log(modifiers);\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n* **Breaking change** Use\n  [`containerProps`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#containerprops)\n  to pass props to the container `div` element. Before, any prop was passed to\n  the container element degrading performance\n  ([#255](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/255)):\n\n  ```diff\n  <DayPicker\n  -    data-thing=\"foo\"\n  +    containerProps={ 'data-thing': 'foo' }\n  />\n  ```\n\n---\n\n# [v4.0.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v4.0.0) (2017-02-10)\n\n* Pass the day's modifiers to the `renderDay` prop function\n  ([#237](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/237))\n\n* **Breaking change** Updating `initialMonth` will not show anymore a different\n  month after the first mount\n  ([#169](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/169))\n\n  If you need the calendar to display a different month, use the\n  [`month`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#month) prop.\n\n* **Breaking change** Use `lang` HTML attribute instead of a specific CSS class\n  name.\n\n  This change may break your style or layout if you are styling the component\n  according to the current locale. If this is the case, change your CSS to use\n  the `lang` attribute selector. For examples, if you are styling the calendar\n  for the `de` locale:\n\n  ```diff\n  - .DayPicker--de {\n  + .DayPicker[lang=\"de\"] {\n    background: yellow;\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### [v3.1.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v3.1.1) (2016-10-18)\n\n* Fixed [an issue](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/227) with IE\n  and older Safari.\n\n## [v3.1.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v3.1.0) (2016-10-14)\n\n* New `months`, `weekdaysLong`, `weekdaysShort`, `firstDayOfWeek` props to\n  localize the component.\n\n**Easier localization**\n\nWith these new props you can localize the Day Picker in a more declarative way.\nCheck out [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/?localized).\n\n---\n\n### [v3.0.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v3.0.1) (2016-10-14)\n\n* Fixed [a bug](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/224) with\n  MomentLocaleUtils.\n\n# [v3.0.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v3.0.0) (2016-10-11)\n\n* Fixed [an issue](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/207) with\n  weekdays labels ([#220](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/220) by\n  [makenosound](https://github.com/makenosound)).\n* Removed `weekdayComponent` and `navbarComponent` props (deprecated from\n  [v2.3.0](#v230-2016-06-30))\n\n**Breaking changes**\n\nFor any locale, weekday names must now begin from Sunday, and the first day of\nweek should reflect this change (hence to start from Monday, the first day of\nweek is `1`).

Please use\n`navbarElement` and `weekdayElement`:\n\n```diff\n- <DayPicker navbarComponent={ MyCustomNavbar } weekdayComponent={ MyCustomWeekday } />\n+ <DayPicker navbarElement={ <MyCustomNavbar/> } weekdayElement={ <MyCustomWeekday /> } />\n```\n\n## [v2.2.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.2.0) (2016-06-09)\n\nAdded `fixedWeeks` prop\n([#176](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/176) by\n[fcsonline](https://github.com/fcsonline)). Use this prop to always display 6\nweeks per month: [example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/?fixedWeeks).\n\n### [v2.1.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.1.1) (2016-06-06)\n\nFixed compatibility with IE11\n([#175](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/175) by\n[davidspiess](https://github.com/davidspiess)).\n\n## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.1.0) (2016-06-02)\n\n* Added\n  [`weekdayComponent`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#weekdaycomponent-component)\n  prop ([#172](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/172) by\n  [stanislav-ermakov-roi](https://github.com/stanislav-ermakov-roi)). Use this\n  prop to use a custom component for rendering the weekday cells in the header.\n* Added\n  [`navbarComponent`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#navbarcomponent-component)\n  prop ([#173](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/173) by\n  [stanislav-ermakov-roi](https://github.com/stanislav-ermakov-roi)). Use this\n  prop to use a custom component for rendering the navigation bar.\n\n### [v2.0.3](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.0.3) (2016-05-24)\n\nIncluded the dist version in the npm package.\n\n### [v2.0.2](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.0.2) (2016-05-24)\n\nFixed a bug when `canChangeMonth` is set to `true`\n([\\#168](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/168)).\n\n### [v2.0.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.0.1) (2016-05-15)\n\nFix npm release.\n\n## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.0.0) (2016-05-15)\n\nThis release mainly improves the component’s API (thus some breaking changes)\nand add some new props.\n\nCode has been split in multiple components and tests have been rewritten with\n[enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme). It should be easier to add and test\nthe upcoming new features!\n\nThanks everyone for the support and for the help on making this component better\n🤗 If you have issues or suggestions, don't forget the\n[Gitter room](https://gitter.im/gpbl/react-day-picker)!\n\n**Breaking changes**\n\n* The `onDay*` event handlers receive as third argument an object of modifiers\n  instead of an array.\n\nThis mean that if you where writing:\n\n```js\nonDayClick(e, day, modifiers) {\n  if (modifiers.indexOf('selected') > -1) {\n    console.log('This day is selected')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nyou must now write:\n\n```js\nonDayClick(e, day, modifiers) {\n  if (modifiers.selected === true) {\n    console.log('This day is selected')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nor better:\n\n```js\nonDayClick(e, day, { selected }) {\n  if (selected) {\n    console.log('This day is selected')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* Removed `onDayTouchTap`. Use `onDayClick` instead. If you need more\n  granularity over touch events, you can use the new `onDayTouchStart` and\n  `onDayTouchEnd` props. See\n  [#153](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/153) for more details.\n\n* Fixed import with CommonJS modules\n  ([#136](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/136)).\n\nThis affects code using `require('react-day-picker').default` or similar syntax,\nwhich was required for v1.3.0. Now you can `require('react-day-picker')` as\nusual, i.e. without specifying `default`. If you are using ES2015 modules\n`import DayPicker from 'react-day-picker'`, this change shouldn't affect you.\n\n* New `formatDay` function in\n  [LocaleUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/utils-locale.html).\n\nIf you are using your\n[custom LocaleUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#advanced)\nto localize the calendar, you need to implement this function as well, which is\nrequired to format the newly added\n[aria-label attribute](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/132) (see\nthe\n[documentation](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#advanced)\nfor an example). If you are localizing\n[using moment](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#moment),\nthis change shouldn't affect you.\n\n**New props**\n\n* New\n  [`disabledDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#disabledays-prop)\n  and\n  [`selectedDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#disabledays-prop)\n  props.
