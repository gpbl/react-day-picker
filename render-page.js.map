There are some possible breaking changes, but they are easy to fix (read\\nbelow).\\n\\n**Breaking changes**\\n\\n* The container's HTML structure has changed: the interactive element used to\\n  focus the calendar has been moved into a wrapper to improve accessibility\\n  ([#392](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/392)):\\n\\n  ```diff\\n  <div className=\\\"DayPicker\\\">\\n  + <div className=\\\"DayPicker-wrapper\\\">\\n    <!-- rendered stuff here -->\\n  + </div>\\n  </div>\\n  ```\\n\\n  This is a **breaking change** if you are styling the component using your own\\n  CSS or with the `classNames` prop.\\n\\n  * If you are styling with your own stylesheet, rename your `.DayPicker`\\n    selector to `.DayPicker-wrapper`:\\n\\n  ```diff\\n  - .DayPicker {\\n  + .DayPicker-wrapper {\\n  ```\\n\\n  * If you are using `classNames` with the `container` prop, rename the\\n    `container` className to `wrapper`.\\n\\n* The container element is now an `inline-block` element.\\n\\n* When using `fromMonth`/`toMonth` props, navigation buttons now are rendered\\n  and hidden via CSS. Before, the buttons were not rendered at all, and it was\\n  impossible to style them\\n  ([#366](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/366))\\n\\n  This is a **breaking change** if you are using those props and styling the\\n  component using your own CSS or with the `classNames` prop.\\n\\n  In such cases, the buttons will be always shown even if the previous or the\\n  next months are not navigable.\\n\\n  * If you are styling with your own stylesheet, add a\\n    `.DayPicker-NavButton--interactionDisabled` selector to your style with\\n    `display: none`.\\n  * If you are using `classNames`, add a `navButtonInteractionDisabled` to your\\n    `classNames` with `display: none` to hide the buttons.\\n\\n* Improved rendering performance using `shouldComponentUpdate` and\\n  `PureComponent` ([#389](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/389))\\n\\n  It should not be a breaking change, but if something is not working for you\\n  when updating some props please file an issue 🙃\\n\\n**Improvements**\\n\\n* Allow `{after, before}` modifiers in the same object\\n  ([#354](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/354)). You can now\\n  write before/after modifiers such as `disabledDays={ { before: aDate, after:\\n  aDate }}`.\\n* **DayPickerInput**: added\\n  [`clickUnselectsDay`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-input.html#clickunselectsday)\\n  prop to unselect and clear the input when clicking on a previously selected\\n  day ([#399](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/399))\\n\\n**Bug fixes**\\n\\n* Fixed an issue where users were able to focus outside days\\n  ([#400](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/400) by\\n  [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))\\n* Fixed an issue with Internet Explorer 11\\n  ([#403](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/403) by\\n  [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))\\n* **a11y**: fixed a warning `You have an unlabeled element or control.` shown\\n  with react-a11y ([#386](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/386))\\n* **DayPickerInput**: fixed an issue when updating the `month`'s\\n  `dayPickerProps` value\\n  ([#380](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/380) by\\n  [Yustynn](https://github.com/Yustynn))\\n\\n**Improvements in the built version**\\n\\nThese changes applies to the production build from the `lib` dir (e.g. that\\nserved from unpkg.com).\\n\\n* Removed prop types from production build\\n  ([#349](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/349))\\n* Include `DayPicker.Input` in the built file\\n  ([#383](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/383))\\n\\n  Use `<DayPicker.Input />` to render the input component.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### [v5.5.3](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.5.3) (2017-05-25)\\n\\n* Bugfix for `DayPickerInput`: updated `value` prop now will be reflected in the\\n  component's state\\n  ([#363](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/363))\\n\\n## [v5.5.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.5.0) (2017-05-09)\\n\\n**New DayPickerInput component**\\n\\nUse the `DayPickerInput` component to render an input field interacting with the\\nday picker ([#213](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/213)).\\n\\nSee [example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/input.html),\\n[docs](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/input.html) and\\n[API reference](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-input.html).\\n\\n**New features**\\n\\n* New\\n  [`todayButton`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#todaybutton)\\n  prop ([#329](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/329)).\\n\\n  Use this prop to display a button on the calendar's footer to switch to the\\n  current month\\n  ([example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/customization-today-button.html)).\\n\\n* New\\n  [`showWeekDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#showweekdays)\\n  and\\n  [`onWeekClick`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#onweekclick)\\n  props ([#304](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/304)).\\n\\n  Use this props to display and interact with the year's week numbers\\n  ([example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/customization-week-numbers.html)).\\n\\n* New `daysOfWeek`\\n  [modifiers type](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/modifiers.html) to match\\n  days of the weeks\\n  ([#330](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/330)).\\n\\n  For example, to match Sundays and Mondays:\\n\\n  ```diff\\n  <DayPicker\\n    disabledDays={\\n  -

Before, any prop was passed to\\n  the container element degrading performance\\n  ([#255](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/255)):\\n\\n  ```diff\\n  <DayPicker\\n  -    data-thing=\\\"foo\\\"\\n  +    containerProps={ 'data-thing': 'foo' }\\n  />\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n# [v4.0.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v4.0.0) (2017-02-10)\\n\\n* Pass the day's modifiers to the `renderDay` prop function\\n  ([#237](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/237))\\n\\n* **Breaking change** Updating `initialMonth` will not show anymore a different\\n  month after the first mount\\n  ([#169](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/169))\\n\\n  If you need the calendar to display a different month, use the\\n  [`month`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#month) prop.\\n\\n* **Breaking change** Use `lang` HTML attribute instead of a specific CSS class\\n  name.\\n\\n  This change may break your style or layout if you are styling the component\\n  according to the current locale. If this is the case, change your CSS to use\\n  the `lang` attribute selector.

It should be easier to add and test\\nthe upcoming new features!\\n\\nThanks everyone for the support and for the help on making this component better\\n🤗 If you have issues or suggestions, don't forget the\\n[Gitter room](https://gitter.im/gpbl/react-day-picker)!\\n\\n**Breaking changes**\\n\\n* The `onDay*` event handlers receive as third argument an object of modifiers\\n  instead of an array.\\n\\nThis mean that if you where writing:\\n\\n```js\\nonDayClick(e, day, modifiers) {\\n  if (modifiers.indexOf('selected') > -1) {\\n    console.log('This day is selected')\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nyou must now write:\\n\\n```js\\nonDayClick(e, day, modifiers) {\\n  if (modifiers.selected === true) {\\n    console.log('This day is selected')\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nor better:\\n\\n```js\\nonDayClick(e, day, { selected }) {\\n  if (selected) {\\n    console.log('This day is selected')\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n* Removed `onDayTouchTap`. Use `onDayClick` instead. If you need more\\n  granularity over touch events, you can use the new `onDayTouchStart` and\\n  `onDayTouchEnd` props. See\\n  [#153](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/153) for more details.\\n\\n* Fixed import with CommonJS modules\\n  ([#136](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/136)).\\n\\nThis affects code using `require('react-day-picker').default` or similar syntax,\\nwhich was required for v1.3.0. Now you can `require('react-day-picker')` as\\nusual, i.e. without specifying `default`. If you are using ES2015 modules\\n`import DayPicker from 'react-day-picker'`, this change shouldn't affect you.\\n\\n* New `formatDay` function in\\n  [LocaleUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/utils-locale.html).\\n\\nIf you are using your\\n[custom LocaleUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#advanced)\\nto localize the calendar, you need to implement this function as well, which is\\nrequired to format the newly added\\n[aria-label attribute](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/132) (see\\nthe\\n[documentation](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#advanced)\\nfor an example). If you are localizing\\n[using moment](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#moment),\\nthis change shouldn't affect you.\\n\\n**New props**\\n\\n* New\\n  [`disabledDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#disabledays-prop)\\n  and\\n  [`selectedDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#disabledays-prop)\\n  props. They receive a function `(day) => Bool` as value to easily define which\\n  day should have the `selected` or `disabled` modifiers. See\\n  [#34](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/34) for more details.\\n\\n  So if you were writing something like:\\n\\n  ```jsx\\n  <DayPicker\\n    modifiers={\\n      ({ selected: day => isDaySelected(day) },\\n      { disabled: day => isDayDisabled(day) })\\n    }\\n  />;\\n  ```\\n\\n  now you can write:\\n\\n  ```jsx\\n  <DayPicker\\n    selectedDays={day => isDaySelected(day)}\\n    disabledDays={day => isDayDisabled(day)}\\n  />;\\n  ```\\n\\n* Added\\n  [`reverseMonths`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#reversemonths-prop)\\n  prop to render the most recent month first.\\n  ([#147](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/141) by\\n  [sonrtomas](sonrtomas))\\n* Added\\n  [`onDayKeyDown`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#ondaykeydown-prop),\\n  [`onDayTouchStart`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#ondaytouchstart-prop),\\n  [`onDayTouchEnd`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#ondaytouchend-prop)\\n  props.\\n\\n**Improvements**\\n\\n* Navigate between weeks or years using left/right or up/down arrow keys\\n  ([#132](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/132) by\\n  [limscoder](https://github.com/limscoder))\\n* Added various `aria-*` attributes\\n  ([#132](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/132) by\\n  [limscoder](https://github.com/limscoder))\\n\\n**Bug fixes**\\n\\n* Navigation with keyboard when using `fromMonth` or `endMonth`\\n\\n---\\n\\n### [v1.3.2](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.3.12) (2016-04-10)\\n\\nAdds React 15 to the peer dependencies.\\n\\n### [v1.3.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.3.1) (2016-03-02)\\n\\nFixes an issue causing className being overwritten by `className` prop\\n([\\\\#137](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/137)).\\n\\n## [v1.3.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.3.0) (2016-02-18)\\n\\n**Improvements**\\n\\n* Support for Babel 6\\n  ([#90](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/90))\\n  * See this [known issue](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/136)\\n* HTML props are spread to container tag, so to support `onBlur`, `onFocus`,\\n  etc. ([#122](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/122),\\n  [#123](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/123))\\n* Better RTL support for month navigation\\n  ([#125](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/125))\\n\\n## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.2.0) (2015-12-04)\\n\\n**New features**\\n\\n* Use a custom caption element with the new\\n  [`captionElement`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#captionelement-element)\\n  prop.
