### Install the Packages

Add `react-day-picker` and `date-fns` to your project:

```bash
npm install react-day-picker date-fns --save
```

### Include the Base Style

Import the CSS file from the `react-day-picker` package:

```js title="global.css"
@import 'react-day-picker/style.css';
```

### Start using DayPicker

Import `DayPicker` in your code to start building your calendar:

```js
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

export default function MyApp() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState(new Date());

  return (
    <div role="application">
      <DayPicker selected={selected} onSelect={setSelected} />
      <p>Picked Day: {selected.toLocaleDateString()}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

{/* <PreviewBox preview={<Examples.Start />} /> */}
