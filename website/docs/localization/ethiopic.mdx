title: Ethiopic Calendar
---

DayPicker supports the [Ethiopic calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_calendar) via a dedicated build.

Import `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker/ethiopic` to display Ethiopic months, weekdays, and numerals while keeping the usual DayPicker API.

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/ethiopic";
```

### Basic usage

By default, the locale is `amET` with Ge'ez numerals.

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/ethiopic";

<DayPicker />;
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.Ethiopic />
</BrowserWindow>

### Latin numerals

Switch to Latin numerals:

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/ethiopic";

<DayPicker numerals="latn" />;
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.EthiopicLatin />
</BrowserWindow>
