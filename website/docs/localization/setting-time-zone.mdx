DayPicker can render dates in a specific time zone so that what users see matches their local time or a time zone you explicitly choose. Internally, this is handled via the time zone support in [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/docs/Time-Zones).

By default, DayPicker uses the browser’s local time zone. You can override this with the `timeZone` prop.

The time zone can be specified as either an [IANA time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) identifier or a UTC offset.

| Prop Name  | Type     | Description                                            |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `timeZone` | `string` | The IANA time zone to use when rendering the calendar. |

```tsx
<DayPicker timeZone="UTC" /> // Coordinated Universal Time
<DayPicker timeZone="Pacific/Honolulu" /> // US Hawaii Time
<DayPicker timeZone="Europe/Paris" /> // Central European Time
<DayPicker timeZone="UTC+2" /> // UTC plus 2 hours
<DayPicker timeZone="UTC-5" /> // UTC minus 5 hours
```

## Working with time-zoned dates

When working with time zones, use the `TZDate` object exported by `react-day-picker` instead of the native `Date` object. `TZDate` ensures your user interface always reads and writes dates in the time zone you specify.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { DayPicker, TZDate } from "react-day-picker";

export function TimeZone() {
  const timeZone = "Pacific/Honolulu";
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<Date | undefined>(
    TZDate.tz(timeZone), // Use `TZDate` instead of `Date`
  );
  return (
    <DayPicker
      mode="single"
      timeZone={timeZone}
      selected={selected}
      onSelect={setSelected}
      footer={
        selected
          ? selected.toString()
          : `Pick a day to see it is in ${timeZone} time zone.`
      }
    />
  );
}
```

<BrowserWindow bodyStyle={{ justifyContent: "start" }}>
  <Examples.TimeZone />
</BrowserWindow>
