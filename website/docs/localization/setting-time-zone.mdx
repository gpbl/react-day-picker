DayPicker can render dates in a specific time zone so that what users see matches their local time or a time zone you explicitly choose. Internally, this is handled via the time zone support in [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/docs/Time-Zones).

By default, DayPicker uses the browser’s local time zone. You can override this with the `timeZone` prop.

The time zone can be specified as either an [IANA time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) identifier or a UTC offset.

| Prop Name  | Type     | Description                                            |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `timeZone` | `string` | The IANA time zone to use when rendering the calendar. |

```tsx
<DayPicker timeZone="UTC" /> // Coordinated Universal Time
<DayPicker timeZone="Pacific/Honolulu" /> // US Hawaii Time
<DayPicker timeZone="Europe/Paris" /> // Central European Time
<DayPicker timeZone="UTC+2" /> // UTC plus 2 hours
<DayPicker timeZone="UTC-5" /> // UTC minus 5 hours
```

## Working with time-zoned dates

When working with time zones, use the `TZDate` object exported by `react-day-picker` instead of the native `Date` object. `TZDate` ensures your user interface always reads and writes dates in the time zone you specify.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { DayPicker, TZDate } from "react-day-picker";

export function TimeZone() {
  const timeZone = "Pacific/Honolulu";
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<Date | undefined>(
    TZDate.tz(timeZone), // Use `TZDate` instead of `Date`
  );
  return (
    <DayPicker
      mode="single"
      timeZone={timeZone}
      selected={selected}
      onSelect={setSelected}
      footer={
        selected
          ? selected.toString()
          : `Pick a day to see it is in ${timeZone} time zone.`
      }
    />
  );
}
```

<BrowserWindow bodyStyle={{ justifyContent: "start" }}>
  <Examples.TimeZone />
</BrowserWindow>

## Historical time zones with second offsets

Some historical time zones use offsets with seconds (for example `Asia/Dubai` in
1900 is `+03:41:12`). JavaScript `Date` and `date-fns` round offsets to minutes,
which can push midnight calculations into the previous day. You can opt into a
“noon-safe” date library that keeps all calendar math at 12:00 in the chosen
time zone so the date never drifts.

Import the helper from the optional submodule (kept out of the default bundle):

```ts
import { createNoonDateLibOverrides } from "react-day-picker/noon-date-lib";

const timeZone = "Asia/Dubai";
const noonSafe = createNoonDateLibOverrides({ timeZone, weekStartsOn: 1 });

<DayPicker timeZone={timeZone} dateLib={noonSafe} />;
```

This override is optional and only needed when you render months that include
offsets with seconds and want to avoid duplicate or missing days in the grid.

<BrowserWindow bodyStyle={{ justifyContent: "start" }}>
  <Examples.TimeZoneNoonSafe />
</BrowserWindow>
