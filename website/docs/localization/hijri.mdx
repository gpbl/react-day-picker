title: Hijri Calendar
---

DayPicker supports the [Hijri (Umm al-Qura) calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar) via a dedicated build.

Import `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker/hijri` to render Hijri months and weekdays while keeping the usual DayPicker API.

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/hijri";
```

### Basic usage (Arabic labels, RTL, Arabic-Indic digits)

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/hijri";

<DayPicker />;
```

<BrowserWindow sourceUrl="https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/main/examples/Hijri.tsx">
  <Examples.Hijri />
</BrowserWindow>

### English labels, LTR, Latin digits

```tsx
import { DayPicker, enUS } from "react-day-picker/hijri";

<DayPicker locale={enUS} dir="ltr" numerals="latn" />;
```

<BrowserWindow sourceUrl="https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/main/examples/HijriEn.tsx">
  <Examples.HijriEn />
</BrowserWindow>

:::note
The Hijri build uses Umm al-Qura conversion tables with a supported Gregorian range of `1924-08-01` to `2077-11-16`. Out-of-range date props are clamped to this interval.
