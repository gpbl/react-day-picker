title: Hebrew Calendar
---

DayPicker supports the [Hebrew calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar) via a dedicated build.

Import `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker/hebrew` to render Hebrew months (including Adar I/II in leap years) with RTL layout by default.

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/hebrew";
```

### Basic usage

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/hebrew";

<DayPicker />;
```

<BrowserWindow sourceUrl="https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/main/examples/Hebrew.tsx">
  <Examples.Hebrew />
</BrowserWindow>

### English labels, LTR, Latin digits

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/hebrew";
import { enUS } from "react-day-picker/locale";

<DayPicker locale={enUS} dir="ltr" numerals="latn" />;
```

<BrowserWindow sourceUrl="https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/main/examples/HebrewEn.tsx">
  <Examples.HebrewEn />
</BrowserWindow>
