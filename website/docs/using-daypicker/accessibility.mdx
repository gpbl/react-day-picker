# Accessibility

DayPicker is designed to adhere to the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/datepicker-dialog/) for date pickers. This includes features such as keyboard navigation, focus management, and labeling.

Depending on your design, you may need to add new accessibility features. For instance, when working with [Input Fields](/advanced-guides/input-fields), there could be some restrictions depending on the level of accessibility you aim to achieve. Stay updated with the best practices by following the [ARIA Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).

## ARIA Labels Translation

When translating the date picker to another language, it's necessary to update the ARIA labels to match the new language. Refer to [Localization](/using-daypicker/localization#aria-labels) for more information.
