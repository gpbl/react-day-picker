# Accessibility

DayPicker is designed to adhere to the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/datepicker-dialog/) for date pickers. This includes features such as keyboard navigation, focus management, and labeling.

Depending on your design, you may need to add new accessibility features. For instance, when working with [Input Fields](../advanced-guides/input-fields), there could be some restrictions depending on the level of accessibility you aim to achieve. Stay updated with the best practices by following the [ARIA Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).

## Accessibility Tips

- Test your date picker with a screen reader.
- In your UI, implement an `aria-live` region to announce when a selection is made.
- Use the `role` prop to define the ARIA role of the date picker.
- Use the [`labels`](../api/interfaces/PropsBase.md#labels) prop to customize the ARIA labels.

### Example

An accessible date picker with a live region that announces the selected date.

```tsx title="./AccessibleDatePicker.tsx"
import React, { useState } from "react";

import { format } from "date-fns";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

export function AccessibleDatePicker() {
  const [meetingDate, setMeetingDate] = useState<Date | undefined>(undefined);
  return (
    <div role="group" aria-labelledby="meeting-date">
      <h2 id="meeting-date">Meeting Date</h2>
      <DayPicker
        mode="single"
        onSelect={setMeetingDate}
        selected={meetingDate}
        labels={{
          labelCaption: () => "Select a date for the meeting",
          labelDay: (date, modifiers) => {
            return modifiers.selected
              ? `Selected Meeting Date: ${format(date, "PPP")}`
              : "";
          }
        }}
        footer={
          <p aria-live="polite">
            {meetingDate
              ? `Meeting date is set to ${format(meetingDate, "PPPP")}`
              : "Please pick a date for the meeting."}
          </p>
        }
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.AccessibleDatePicker />
</BrowserWindow>

## Keyboard Navigation

DayPicker supports keyboard navigation to make it easier for users to navigate the calendar. The following keys are supported:
