# Styling

DayPicker comes with a minimal style inspired by MacOS date pickers, designed to be extended and customized.

You can also use your own styles, or use a CSS framework like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) or [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) to style the calendar.

## Default Style

To start with the included styles, import `react-day-picker/style.css` into your app. This will add the `.rdp` class names used by DayPicker.

<details>
<summary>Using a bundler or a React framework</summary>

If you are using a React framework, such as [Next.js](http://nextjs.org) or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), or a bundler like Webpack with [css-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/), import the CSS file from your app's main JavaScript or TypeScript file:

```tsx title="./App.jsx"
import "react-day-picker/style.css";
```

</details>

### Importing the CSS Module

You can import `style.module.css` if you want your CSS pre-processor to parse it. Pass the imported styles to the `classNames` prop.

```tsx title="./MyDatePicker.jsx"
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";
import styles from "react-day-picker/style.module.css";

console.log(styles); // Output the class names as parsed by CSS modules.

export function MyDatePicker() {
  return <DayPicker classNames={styles} />;
}
```

  <Examples.CssModules />
</BrowserWindow>

### CSS Variables

The default styles use CSS variables that can be overridden to customize the appearance of the calendar. Define the CSS variables in your app's CSS file, after importing the DayPicker CSS file:

```css title="./app/global.css"
@import "react-day-picker/style.css";

:root {
  --rdp-accent-color: indigo; /* Change the accent color to indigo. */
}
```

The following table lists the CSS variables used by DayPicker:

### Light/Dark Appearance

```css
:root {
  --rdp-accent-color: blue; /* Use blue as the accent color. */
}
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --rdp-accent-color: yellow; /* Use yellow as the accent color in dark mode. */
}
```

## Custom Style

Use the `classNames` prop to use other classnames instead of the default ones.
