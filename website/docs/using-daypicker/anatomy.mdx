# DayPicker Anatomy

To better follow the docs, get familiar with the elements composing DayPicker.

- **Navigation Bar**: with the arrows to move between months.
- **Month Caption**: the title of the current month.
- **Weekdays Row**: the row displaying the names of the weekdays.
- **Weeks**: the rows displaying the days of the month.
- **Day**: the day of the month, that can get different _modifiers_, such as
  - `selected`: the day is selected.
  - `disabled`: the day is disabled.
  - `today`: the day is today.
  - `outside`: the day is outside the current month.
- **Footer**: an ARIA live region that can be used to announce the selected date.

The UI elements are mapped to CSS classes. A complete list can be found in the [`UI`](../api//enumerations/UI.md) enum.
