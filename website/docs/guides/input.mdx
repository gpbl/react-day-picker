Use the [useInput hook](/api/functions/useinput) to bind an input field with
DayPicker.

:::caution Experimental feature
The hook is still a work in progress and it could not work as expected.
:::

1. call `useInput` hook by passing the initial day and the [format
   string](https://date-fns.org/v2.17.0/docs/format); 2. use the returned props for
   the `DayPicker` and the `input` component;

For example, this app calls `useInput` to bind an input field to DayPicker.

```jsx showOutput
import { DayPicker, useInput } from 'react-day-picker';

function App() {
  const { dayPickerProps, inputProps } = useInput(new Date(), 'yyyy-MM-dd');
  return (
    <>
      <p>
        Type a day or pick one from the calendar:
        <input {...inputProps} placeholder="YYYY-MM-DD" />
      </p>
      <DayPicker {...dayPickerProps} />
    </>
  );
}
```
