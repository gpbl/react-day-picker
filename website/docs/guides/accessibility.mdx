# Accessible Date Pickers

DayPicker follows the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/datepicker-dialog/) for date pickers, including features like keyboard navigation, focus management, and labeling.

Depending on your design, you might need to add more accessibility features. For example, when using [Input Fields](../guides/input-fields), there may be some limitations based on your accessibility goals. Keep up with best practices by following the [ARIA Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).

:::tip Accessibility Tips

- Test your date picker regularly with a screen reader to ensure accessibility.
- Use an `aria-live` region to announce when a date is selected, like using the `footer` prop.
- Customize ARIA labels with the [`labels`](../api/interfaces/PropsBase.md#labels) prop for better user feedback.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast between text and background.
- Offer instructions for first-time users or those unfamiliar with the date picker.

## Accessibility Props

| Prop Name    | Type                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `labels`     | [`Labels`](../api/type-aliases/Labels.md) | Map of the ARIA labels used within DayPicker for better accessibility.                                                                                                 |
| `footer`     | `ReactNode` \| `string`                   | Add a footer to the calendar, which can act as a [live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) to announce updates. |
| `role`       | `application` \| `dialog`                 | Set the ARIA role for the container. Use `application` for a more interactive widget or `dialog` for a modal-like date picker.                                         |
| `aria-label` | `string`                                  | The label to use for the container when a `role` is set, providing a descriptive text for screen readers.                                                              |
| `autoFocus`  | `boolean`                                 | Autofocus the calendar when it opens, improving keyboard navigation.                                                                                                   |

### Autofocusing the Calendar {#autofocus}

DayPicker automatically manages focus when users interact with the calendar. To enhance accessibility, you can autofocus the calendar when it opens by using the `autoFocus` prop:

```tsx
<DayPicker mode="single" autoFocus />
```

## Keyboard Navigation

DayPicker supports keyboard navigation to make it easier for users to navigate the calendar. The following keys are supported:

| Keys                         | Function                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>Arrow Up</kbd>          | Move focus to the previous week.     |
| <kbd>Arrow Right</kbd>       | Move focus to the next day.          |
| <kbd>Arrow Down</kbd>        | Move focus to the next week.         |
