title: Changing Months Programmatically
---

As default, the current month is stored into the DayPicker’s internal state. To
change the month programmatically, the current month must be stored in the
parent's state.

1. save the month to render in the parent component’s state
2. use the `month` prop (as opposed to `initialMonth`)
3. use the `onMonthChange` event handler to set the month

```jsx showOutput
function App() {
  const [month, setMonth] = useState();
  return (
    <>
      <DayPicker month={month} onMonthChange={setMonth} />
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => setMonth(new Date())}>Go to Today</button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```
