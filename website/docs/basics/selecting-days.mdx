# Selecting Days

DayPicker supports four selection modes:

- single: only a single day can be selected
- multiple: allow selection of multiple days
- range: allow the selection of range of days
- custom: let the parent component handle the selection

## Single selection mode

To enable single day selection, set `mode="single"` and use `onSelect` to get
the selected day.

```include
selecting-days-single.tsx
```

### Making a selection required

To make a selection required, use `defautSelected` with `required`.

For example, to set the default selected date to today:

```include
selecting-days-single-min.tsx
```

## Selecting multiple days

Use `mode="multiple"` to allow the selection of multiple days:

```include
selecting-days-multiple.tsx
```

### Limiting the selectable days

Use the `min` and `max` props to limit the amount of days that can be selected.

```include
selecting-days-multiple-min-max.tsx
```

## Selecting a range of days

Use `mode="range"` and `onSelectRange` to allow the selection of multiple days.

```include
selecting-days-range.tsx
```

### Limiting the range size

Use the `min` and `max` props to limit the amount of days in the range.

```include
selecting-days-range-min-max.tsx
```

## Custom selection mode

If the built-in selection modes are not enough for your appâ€™s requirements, you
can control the selection behavior using `mode="custom"`.

See the [Custom
Selections guide](/guides/custom-selections) for more details.
