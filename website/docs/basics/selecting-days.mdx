# Selecting Days

DayPicker supports four selection modes:

- single: only a single day can be selected
- multiple: allow selection of multiple days
- range: allow the selection of range of days
- custom: let the parent component handle the selection

## Single selection mode

To enable single day selection, set `mode="single"` and use `onSelect` to get
the selected day.

```include
single.tsx
```

### Making a selection required

To make a selection required, use `defautSelected` with `required`.

For example, to set the default selected date to today:

```include
single-required.tsx
```

## Selecting multiple days

Use `mode="multiple"` to allow the selection of multiple days:

```include
multiple.tsx
```

### Limiting the selectable days

Use the `min` and `max` props to limit the amount of days that can be selected.

```include
multiple-min-max.tsx
```

## Selecting a range of days

Use `mode="range"` and `onSelectRange` to allow the selection of multiple days.

```include
range.tsx
```

### Limiting the range size

Use the `min` and `max` props to limit the amount of days in the range.

```include
range-min-max.tsx
```

## Custom selection mode

If the built-in selection modes are not enough for your app’s requirements, you
can control the selection behavior using `mode="custom"`.

### Example: custom single select

The following example use the custom selection mode to implement the "single selection" behavior. It is like when `mode="single"`, we place it here to show how the custom selection works.

```include
custom-single.tsx
```

### Example: custom multiple select

The case of a multi-days select is a bit more complex as it deals with an array. The following example replicates the `mode="multiple"` selection mode.

```include
custom-multiple.tsx
```
