## Change the initial month

DayPicker displays the month of the current day. To change the
initial month, set the `defaultMonth` prop:

```include
examples/navigation-initialmonth.tsx
```

### Controlling the current month

The current month is stored into the DayPicker’s internal state.

To control the current month – for example, to create a "Go to today"
button – set it in the parent’s state.

Use `month` (as opposed to `defaultMonth`) and `onMonthChange` to handle the
current month.

```include
examples/navigation-uncontrolled.tsx
```

## Limiting the navigable months

As default, DayPicker will display indefinitely in the past or in the future.

To limit the navigable months between certain dates, use `fromDate` and `toDate`, `fromMonth`
and `toMonth`, or `fromYear` and `toYear`.

```include
examples/navigation-from-to.tsx
```

### Using a dropdown to navigate between months

When limiting the navigable months, use `captionLayout` to display a drop-down
for navigating between months – instead of the previous / next buttons.

```include
examples/navigation-dropdown.tsx
```

## Disabling navigation

To disable the navigation between months, use `disableNavigation`.

```include
examples/navigation-disabled.tsx
```
