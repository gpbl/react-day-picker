# Customization

## Multiple months

Use the `numberOfMonths` to render more than one calendar.

```include
customization-multiple-months.tsx
```

### Paged navigation

When rendering multiple months, use `pagedNavigation` to navigate the number of
months per time.

```include
customization-multiple-months-paged.tsx
```

## Showing the outside days

Use `showOutsideDays` to display the days falling out the current month.

```include
customization-outside-days.tsx
```

## Using fixed weeks

When `showOutsideDays` is turned on, use `fixedWeeks` to display six weeks per
months. This will prevent the calendar to change its height when navigating.

```include
customization-fixedweeks.tsx
```

## Showing the week numbers

Use `showWeekNumber` to display the week numbers.

```include
customization-weeknumber.tsx
```
