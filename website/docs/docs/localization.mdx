# Localization

Learn how to set the locale, adjust the week start day, and apply ISO Week Dates to enhance the user experience across different regions and languages.

## Locale props

| Prop Name               | Type                                          | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `locale`                | [`Locale`](https://date-fns.org/docs/I18n)    | Set the locale. Default is `en-US`.                                |
| `weekStartsOn`          | `1` \| `2` \| `3` \| `4` \| `5` \| `6` \| `7` | Display the days falling into the other months.                    |
| `firstWeekContainsDate` | `1` \| `4`                                    | Configure the first date in the first week of the year.            |
| `ISOWeek`               | `boolean`                                     | Use [ISO Week Dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date). |

## Setting the Locale

### 1. Install date-fns

DayPicker uses the [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) library to localize the calendar. To set a different locale, you need to install `date-fns`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install date-fns
```

### 2. Set a Different Locale

By default, the locale is set to English (US). To localize the calendar, pass a [`Locale`](https://date-fns.org/docs/I18n) object to the `locale` prop.

For example, to localize the calendar in Spanish, import the `es` locale object from date-fns and pass it to the component.

```tsx
import { es } from "date-fns/locale";

<DayPicker locale={es} />; // Set the locale to Spanish
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.Spanish />
</BrowserWindow>

## First Date of the Week

Use the `weekStartsOn` prop to specify the starting day of the week.

```tsx
<DayPicker locale={es} weekStartsOn={0} /> // Start the week on Domingo
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.SpanishWeekStartsOn />
</BrowserWindow>

## First Week Contains Date

The `firstWeekContainsDate` prop can be used to change the first day of the week for the year's initial week, which is used in the calculation of week numbers.

- Acceptable values are `1` for Monday and `4` for Thursday.
- See also [Week Numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week#Numbering) and the [getWeek function](https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeek).

```tsx
<DayPicker
  showWeekNumber
  firstWeekContainsDate={1} // First week must contain Monday
/>
```

## ISO Week Dates

Use `ISOWeek` to switch using [ISO Week Dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) instead of the locale setting.

```tsx
<DayPicker ISOWeek />
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.WeeknumberIso />
</BrowserWindow>

## UTC Dates

DayPicker uses the local time zone by default. To switch to UTC dates, add [@date-fns/utc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@date-fns/utc) to your dependencies and import `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker/utc` instead.

:::note Experimental feature

The UTC mode is an experimental feature. [Please report](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues) any issues you may encounter, thanks!

:::

#### 1. Install the `@date-fns/utc` package

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @date-fns/utc
```

#### 2. Import `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker/utc`

```diff
- import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';
+ import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker/utc';
```

#### 3. Use DayPicker as usual

```tsx
import { UTCDate } from "@date-fns/utc";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/utc";

export function Utc() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState<Date>(new UTCDate());
  return (
    <DayPicker
      mode="single"
      required
      selected={selected}
      onSelect={(date: Date) => {
        setSelected(date);
      }}
      footer={selected ? `Selected: ${selected.toUTCString()}` : null}
    />
  );
}
```

Observe how dates are always GMT.

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.Utc />
</BrowserWindow>

## Jalali Calendar

DayPicker supports the Jalali calendar thanks to the [date-fns-jalali](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns-jalali) package. To switch to the Jalali calendar, add `date-fns-jalali` to your dependencies and import `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker/jalali` instead.

:::note Experimental feature

The support for the Jalali calendar is an experimental feature. [Please report](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues) any issues you may encounter, thanks!

:::

#### 1. Install the `date-fns-jalali` package

```bash npm2yarn
npm install date-fns-jalali
```

#### 2. Import `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker/jalali`

```diff
- import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';
+ import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker/jalali';
```

#### 3. Use DayPicker as usual

Note that you can set the right-to-left direction and change the locale.

```tsx title="./JalaliCalendar.jsx"
import React from "react";

import { faIR } from "date-fns/locale";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/jalali";

export function Jalali() {
  return <DayPicker mode="single" locale={faIR} dir="rtl" />;
}
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.Jalali />
</BrowserWindow>
