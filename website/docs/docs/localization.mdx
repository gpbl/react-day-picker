# Localization

Learn how to set the locale, adjust the starting day of the week, and apply ISO Week Dates to enhance the user experience across different regions and languages.

## Locale props

| Prop Name               | Type                                          | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `locale`                | [`Locale`](https://date-fns.org/docs/I18n)    | Set the locale. Default is `en-US`.                                |
| `weekStartsOn`          | `1` \| `2` \| `3` \| `4` \| `5` \| `6` \| `7` | Display the days falling into the other months.                    |
| `firstWeekContainsDate` | `1` \| `4`                                    | Configure the first date in the first week of the year.            |
| `ISOWeek`               | `boolean`                                     | Use [ISO Week Dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date). |

## Setting the Locale

### 1. Install date-fns

DayPicker uses the [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) library for calendar localization. To set a different locale, install `date-fns`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install date-fns
```

### 2. Set a Different Locale

By default, the locale is set to English (US). To localize the calendar, pass a [`Locale`](https://date-fns.org/docs/I18n) object to the `locale` prop.

For example, to localize the calendar in Spanish, import the `es` locale object from `date-fns` and pass it to the component.

```tsx
import { es } from "date-fns/locale";

<DayPicker locale={es} />; // Set the locale to Spanish
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.Spanish />
</BrowserWindow>

:::tip Customizing the Locale

You can customize the locale by passing an object with the desired translations. Use the `defaultLocale` object for the default translation values.

```tsx
import { DayPicker, defaultLocale } from "react-day-picker";

<DayPicker
  locale={{
    localize: {
      ...defaultLocale.localize,
      day: (day) => "custom-localized-day"
    }
  }}
  month={new Date(2023, 0, 1)}
  mode="single"
/>;
```

:::

## Changing the Time Zone {#time-zone}

Use the `timeZone` prop to set a different time zone for the calendar. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
for a list of the possible values.

```tsx
<DayPicker timeZone="UTC" /> // Use Coordinated Universal Time
<DayPicker timeZone="Pacific/Kiritimati" /> // Use Line Islands Time
```

<BrowserWindow bodyStyle={{ justifyContent: "start" }}>
  <Examples.TimeZone />
</BrowserWindow>

:::note Experimental feature

Time zones are supported by the `TZDate` object by the [@date-fns/tz](https://github.com/date-fns/tz) package. If you encounter any issues, please [report them](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues). Thank you!

## Calendar Options

### First Date of the Week

Use the `weekStartsOn` prop to set the first day of the week.

```tsx
<DayPicker locale={es} weekStartsOn={0} /> // Start the week on Domingo
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.SpanishWeekStartsOn />
</BrowserWindow>

### First Week Contains Date

The `firstWeekContainsDate` prop sets the first day of the year's initial week, which is used to calculate week numbers.

- Acceptable values are `1` for Monday and `4` for Thursday.
- For more information, see [Week Numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week#Numbering) and the [getWeek function](https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeek).

```tsx
<DayPicker
  showWeekNumber
  firstWeekContainsDate={1} // First week must contain Monday
/>
```

### ISO Week Dates

Use the `ISOWeek` prop to switch to [ISO Week Dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) instead of the locale setting.

```tsx
<DayPicker ISOWeek />
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.WeeknumberIso />
</BrowserWindow>

## Jalali Calendar

DayPicker supports the Jalali calendar through the [date-fns-jalali](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns-jalali) package. To switch to the Jalali calendar, add `date-fns-jalali` to your dependencies and import `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker/jalali`.

:::note Experimental feature

Support for the Jalali calendar is an experimental feature. [Please report](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues) any issues you encounter. Thank you!

:::

#### 1. Install the `date-fns-jalali` package

```bash npm2yarn
npm install date-fns-jalali
```

#### 2. Import `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker/jalali`

```diff
- import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';
+ import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker/jalali';
```

#### 3. Use DayPicker as usual

You can set the right-to-left direction and change the locale as needed.

```tsx title="./JalaliCalendar.jsx"
import React from "react";

import { faIR } from "date-fns/locale";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/jalali";

export function Jalali() {
  return <DayPicker mode="single" locale={faIR} dir="rtl" />;
}
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.Jalali />
</BrowserWindow>
