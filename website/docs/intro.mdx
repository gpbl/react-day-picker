# React DayPicker

- 📅 Supports [selections](./docs/selection-modes.mdx) of single day, multiple days, ranges of days, or [custom selections](./guides/custom-selections.mdx).
- 🌍 Can be [localized](./docs/localization.mdx) into any language, supports [ISO 8601 dates](./docs/localization.mdx#iso-week-dates), [UTC dates](./docs/localization.mdx#utc-dates), and [Jalali calendar](./docs/localization.mdx#jalali-calendar).

    <DayPicker
      mode="single"
      selected={selected}
      onSelect={setSelected}
      footer={
        selected ? `Selected: ${selected.toLocaleDateString()}` : "P}ick a day."
