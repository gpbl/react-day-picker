# React DayPicker

DayPicker is a [React](https://react.dev) component for creating date pickers, calendars, and date inputs for web applications.

## Features

- 🎨 Minimal design that can be [easily styled](./docs/styling.mdx) with CSS or any CSS framework.
- 📅 Supports [selections](./docs/selection-modes.mdx) of single days, multiple days, ranges of days, or [custom selections](./guides/custom-selections.mdx).
- 🌍 Can be [localized](./docs/localization.mdx) into any language, supports [ISO 8601 dates](./docs/localization.mdx#iso-week-dates), [time zones](./docs/localization.mdx#time-zone), and the [Jalali calendar](./docs/localization.mdx#jalali-calendar).

    <DayPicker
      mode="single"
      selected={selected}
      onSelect={setSelected}
      footer={
        selected ? `Selected: ${selected.toLocaleDateString()}` : "Pick a day."
