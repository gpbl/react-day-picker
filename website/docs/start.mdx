# Getting Started

## Install the Package

DayPicker is available as `react-day-picker` npm package. It requires [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) as a peer dependency.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-day-picker@next date-fns
```

- See #1087 if you are interested in DayPicker supporting different date
  libraries.

## Basic Usage

To create a simple date picker calendar,

1. Import the component and its default style from `react-day-picker`.
2. Choose a [selection mode](./using-daypicker/selection-modes) using the `mode` prop.
3. Assign the `selected` and `onSelect` props to manage the selected date.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";
import "react-day-picker/style.css";

export function MyDatePicker() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<Date | undefined>();
  return <DayPicker mode="single" selected={selected} onSelect={setSelected} />;
}
```
