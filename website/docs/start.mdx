:::important

This documentation is about the upcoming version, which is still in development.
See [react-day-picker.js.org](http://react-day-picker.js.org) for the
documentation about the current version.

:::

## Installing and importing

Add `react-day-picker` to your projectâ€™s dependencies:

```bash
yarn add react-day-picker@next     # when using yarn
npm install react-day-picker@next  # when using npm
```

Import DayPicker and its CSS file in your script.

```jsx
import "react-day-picker/dist/style.css";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";
```

## Example: selecting days

Familiarize with React DayPicker by implementing a date picker to select days.

To display days as selected, pass one or more dates to the [selected
prop](./api/daypicker#selected). You can also use ranges or other values
to [match days](./modifiers-matching-days.mdx).

```jsx preview
function App() {
  return (
    <DayPicker
      initialMonth={new Date(2020, 8)}
      selected={[
        new Date(2020, 8, 1),
        new Date(2020, 8, 19),
        new Date(2020, 8, 21),
        { after: new Date(2020, 8, 30), before: new Date(2020, 10, 1) }
      ]}
    />
  );
}
```

To make days selectable when clicked, add a state to the component and bind it
to the [onDayClick event handler](./api/daypicker#onDayClick).

```jsx preview
function App() {
  const [selectedDay, setSelectedDay] = useState();
  const handleDayClick = day => setSelectedDay(day);
  const handleDayMouseEnter = day => console.log(day);
  const handleDayKeyDown = day => console.log("keydown :" + day);
  const handleDayKeyUp = day => console.log("keyup :" + day);
  const handleDayKeyPress = day => console.log("keypress :" + day);
  const handleTouch = day => console.log("today is " + day)

  return (
    <DayPicker
      selected={selectedDay}
      onDayClick={handleDayClick}
      onDayMouseEnter={handleDayMouseEnter}
      onDayKeyDown={handleDayKeyDown}
      onDayKeyUp={handleDayKeyUp}
      onDayKeyPress={handleDayKeyPress}
      onDayTouchEvent={handleTouch}
    />
  );
}
```
