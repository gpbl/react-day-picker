2. Choose a [selection mode](./docs/selection-modes) using the `mode` prop.
3. Assign the `selected` and `onSelect` props to manage the selected date.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";
import "react-day-picker/style.css";

export function MyDatePicker() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<Date | undefined>();
  return <DayPicker mode="single" selected={selected} onSelect={setSelected} />;
}
