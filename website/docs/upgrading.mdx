This major version introduce some important breaking changes. See the [changelog](./changelog.mdx) for the full list of changes.

:::warning

This document is still a work in progress. Please help us complete this guide by [opening an issue](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/discussions/categories/daypicker-v9).

:::

Follow these steps to upgrade your project from v8 to v9:

### 1. Upgrade to the next version

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-day-picker@next date-fns
```

### 2. Check for removed props

The following props have been removed. Check in your code if you are using them.

| Removed prop | Notes                                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ~`fromDate`~ | Replace it with the `hidden` prop and the `before` [Matcher](./api/type-aliases/Matcher.md). |
| ~`toDate`~   | Replace it with the `hidden` prop and the `after` [Matcher](./api/type-aliases/Matcher.md).  |

```diff
- <DayPicker fromDate={new Date(2010, 11, 03)} toDate={new Date(2012, 10, 01)} />
+ <DayPicker hidden={[{ before: new Date(2010, 11, 03)}, { after: new Date(2012, 10, 01) }]} />
```

### 3. Check for deprecated props

The following props have been deprecated, and will be removed in the next major version.

| Deprecated prop | Replacement  | Notes                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ~`fromMonth`~   | `startMonth` |                                                                         |
| ~`toMonth`~     | `endMonth`   |                                                                         |
| ~`fromYear`~    | `startMonth` | Pass the first month of the year, e.g. `startMonth = new Date(2024,0)`. |
| ~`toYear`~      | `endMonth`   | Pass the last month of the year, e.g. `endMonth = new Date(2024,11)`.   |

### 2. Updates for ARIA labels

The following ARIA labels have been updated:

| Label                                                   | Old label              | New label        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| [`labelPrevious`](./api/functions/labelPrevious)        | `Go to previous month` | `Previous Month` |
| [`labelNext`](./api/functions/labelNext)                | `Go to next month`     | `Next Month`     |
| [`labelWeekNumber`](./api/functions/labelWeekNumber.md) | `Week nr.`             | `Week`           |

You may need to update your test selectors â€” for example:

```diff title="./test.js"
- screen.getByRole('button', 'Go to previous month');
+ screen.getByRole('button', 'Previous Month');
```

### 3. Formatters: update to return a string

The `formatters` prop now requires functions returning a `string` instead of a `ReactNode`.

If you were [using the formatters](./using-daypicker/localization.mdx#formatters), you may need to update your code or use a `DayDate` component to render a `ReactElement` again: see [custom components guide](./advanced-guides//custom-components.mdx).

```diff
- const MyComponent = () => <DayPicker formatters={{ caption: () => <strong>My caption</strong> }} />;
+ const MyComponent = () => <DayPicker formatters={{ caption: () => 'My caption' }} />;
```

### 4. Custom Components: update the hooks

- `useDayPicker` has ben deprecated and renamed to [`useProps`](./api/functions/useProps.md).
- `useNavigation` has been deprecated and renamed to [`useCalendar`](./api/functions/useCalendar.md).
- `useDayPicker` has been removed in favor of the `Day` custom component. See [custom components guide](./advanced-guides/custom-components.mdx) for more details.

### 5. TypeScript: check for deprecated types

Many typings have been deprecated in favor of clarity and shorter names. If you were using the typings, you may need to update your code or it will break in the next major version.

```diff
- import { DayPickerDefaultProps } from 'react-day-picker';
+ import { PropsDefault } from 'react-day-picker/types';
```
