DayPicker documentation is found in the [./docs](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/next/docs) directory of the repository.

DayPicker is documented in two ways:

- with [Nextra app](http://nextra.site) published in the [the documentation website](https://react-day-picker.dev).
- in the source code, we rely on [tsdocs](https://tsdoc.org) and we generate the API reference from the source code using the [typedoc plugin](https://github.com/tgreyuk/typedoc-plugin-markdown)
