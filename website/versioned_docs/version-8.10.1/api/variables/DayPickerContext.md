# Variable: DayPickerContext

> `const` **DayPickerContext**: `Context`\<`undefined` \| [`DayPickerContextValue`](../interfaces/DayPickerContextValue.md)\>

The DayPicker context shares the props passed to DayPicker within internal
and custom components. It is used to set the default values and perform
one-time calculations required to render the days.

Access to this context from the [useDayPicker](../functions/useDayPicker.md) hook.
