title: Buddhist (Thai) Calendar
---

DayPicker supports the Buddhist (Thai) calendar via a dedicated build. Months and weeks remain Gregorian, while years render in Buddhist Era (BE = CE + 543) and Thai numerals by default.

Import `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker/buddhist` to render Buddhist years while keeping the usual DayPicker API.

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/buddhist";
```

### Basic usage

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/buddhist";

<DayPicker />;
```

<BrowserWindow sourceUrl="https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/main/examples/Buddhist.tsx">
  <ExamplesV9.Buddhist />
</BrowserWindow>

### English locale with latin numerals

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/buddhist";
import { enUS } from "react-day-picker/locale";

<DayPicker locale={enUS} numerals="latn" />;
```

<BrowserWindow sourceUrl="https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/main/examples/BuddhistEn.tsx">
  <ExamplesV9.BuddhistEn />
</BrowserWindow>
