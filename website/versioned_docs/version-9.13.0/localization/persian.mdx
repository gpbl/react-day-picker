DayPicker supports the Persian [Solar Hijri](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendars#Modern_calendar:_Solar_Hijri_(SH)>) calendar via a dedicated build.

Import `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker/persian` to render Persian months and weekdays while keeping the usual DayPicker API.

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/persian";
```

### Farsi labels, Eastern Arabic-Indic digits

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/persian";
import { faIR } from "react-day-picker/locale";
<DayPicker locale={faIR} />;
```

<BrowserWindow sourceUrl="https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/main/examples/Persian.tsx">
  <Examples.Persian />
</BrowserWindow>

### English labels, LTR, Latin digits

```tsx
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker/persian";
import { enUS } from "react-day-picker/locale";

<DayPicker locale={enUS} dir="ltr" numerals="latn" />;
```

<BrowserWindow sourceUrl="https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/main/examples/PersianEn.tsx">
  <Examples.PersianEn />
</BrowserWindow>
