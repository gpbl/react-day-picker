# Getting Started

## Install the Package

DayPicker is available as the `react-day-picker` npm package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-day-picker
```

## Basic Usage

To add a simple date picker to your app:

1. Import the component and styles from `react-day-picker`.
2. Choose a [selection mode](./selections/selection-modes.mdx) using the `mode` prop.
3. Use the `selected` and `onSelect` props to control the selected date.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";
import "react-day-picker/style.css";

export function MyDatePicker() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<Date>();

  return (
    <DayPicker
      animate
      mode="single"
      selected={selected}
      onSelect={setSelected}
      footer={
        selected ? `Selected: ${selected.toLocaleDateString()}` : "Pick a day."
      }
    />
  );
}
```
