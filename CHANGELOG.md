## v7.0.0

\_Release Date: 2017-11-25

**Breaking changes**

- `enableOutsideDays` prop is now named `showOutsideDays`
- if you are using `DayPickerInput`, we removed the moment.js dependency and
  changed how to pass props to the input field (upgrade is easy, see below).
- if you are using commonjs to import the component, change your code:
  ```diff
  - var DayPicker = require('react-day-picker`)
  + var DayPicker = require('react-day-picker`).default
  ```
- if you are using TypeScript and upgrading from `v6.2.1` (see
  [#533](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/533)), use the default
  import:
  ```diff
  - import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker`;
  + import DayPicker from 'react-day-picker';
  ```
- if you are using a custom CSS, consider that now the calendar table is inside
  a `div` with a `.DayPicker-Months` CSS class.

If you find problems while upgrading, please
[add an issue](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/new), thanks!

**New features**

- Improved layout and style. Added `.DayPicker-Months` container.
- Added: [`renderWeek`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPicker`renderWeek)
  prop ([#497](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/497) by
  [jenshandersson](https://github.com/jenshandersson))
- Added:
  [`onTodayButtonClick`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPicker#onTodayButtonClick)
  prop ([#529](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/529))
- Added:
  [`showWeekDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPicker#showWeekDays)
  prop. Set it to `false` to hide weekday names
- Added: `month` prop to
  [`navbarElement`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPicker#navbarElement)
  ([#552](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/552))
- Renamed `enableOutsideDays` prop to
  [`showOutsideDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPicker#showOutsideDays)

**Bug fixes**

  ([#556](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/556) by

### Da

_Release date: PickerInpu_

**Breaking changes**

- The moment.js requirement
  [has been removed](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/518), and you
  should use
  [`parseDate`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#parseDate) and
  [`formatDate`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#formatDate)
  props to parse and format the dates. If you want to keep using moment.js, your
  existing code should changes as follows:

  ```diff
    import DayPicker from 'react-day-picker/DayPickerInput'
  + import { formatDate, parseDate, } from 'react-day-picker/moment';

    function MyDayPicker() {
      return (
        <DayPickerInput
          placeholder="Please choose a date"
          format="LL"
  +       formatDate={formatDate}
  +       parseDate={parseDate}
        >
      );
    }
  ```

  See also [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/input-moment).

- You must pass additional props to the input component using the
  [`inputProps`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#inputProps)
  prop. _This is not a breaking change if you are just using `placeholder` or
  `value`_. E.g.:
  ```diff
  <DayPickerInput
     placeholder="Type a day"
     value={this.state.selectedDay}
  -  onFocus={myFocusHandler}
  -  className="my-input-css"
  +  inputProps={{
  +   onFocus: myFocusHandler,
  +   className: 'my-input-css,
  +  }}
  />
  ```

**New features**

- New:
  [`inputProps`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#inputProps)

- New:
  [`parseDate`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#parseDate) and
  [`formatDate`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#formatDate)
  props
- New:
  [`inputProps`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#inputProps)
  prop to pass additional props to the input component
- New:
  [`overlayComponent`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#overlayComponent)
  prop: useful to customize the overlay component
  ([#477](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/477), thanks to
  [wldcordeiro](https://github.com/wldcordeiro))
- New: allow to change `numberOfMonths`, `selectedDays` props from
  `dayPickerProps` ([#513](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/513),
  [#531](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/531) by
  [hydrognomik](https://github.com/hydrognomik)). Useful for selecting range of
  days ([example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/input-from-to)).
- New:
  [`showOverlay`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#showOverlay)
  prop: shows the overlay at the initial rendering (useful for styling)
- New: [`getInput`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#getInput)
  and
  [`getDayPicker`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/DayPickerInput#getDayPicker)
  public methods

* Changed: clicking the Today Button will set the input value to today
  ([#561](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/561))
* Changed: removed `fixedWeek` prop. Use `dayPickerProps ={{ fixedWeek: true }}`

## v6.0.0

\_Release Date: 2017-06-16

This major release focuses on performance, improves accessibility and fixes some
bugs. There are some possible breaking changes, but they are easy to fix (read
below).

**Breaking changes**

- The container's HTML structure has changed: the interactive element used to
  focus the calendar has been moved into a wrapper to improve accessibility
  ([#392](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/392)):

  ```diff
  <div className="DayPicker">
  + <div className="DayPicker-wrapper">
    <!-- rendered stuff here -->
  + </div>
  </div>
  ```

  This is a **breaking change** if you are styling the component using your own
  CSS or with the `classNames` prop.

  - If you are styling with your own stylesheet, rename your `.DayPicker`
    selector to `.DayPicker-wrapper`:

  ```diff
  - .DayPicker {
  + .DayPicker-wrapper {
  ```

  - If you are using `classNames` with the `container` prop, rename the
    `container` className to `wrapper`.

- The container element is now an `inline-block` element.

- When using `fromMonth`/`toMonth` props, navigation buttons now are rendered
  and hidden via CSS. Before, the buttons were not rendered at all, and it was
  impossible to style them
  ([#366](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/366))

  This is a **breaking change** if you are using those props and styling the
  component using your own CSS or with the `classNames` prop.

  In such cases, the buttons will be always shown even if the previous or the
  next months are not navigable.

  - If you are styling with your own stylesheet, add a
    `.DayPicker-NavButton--interactionDisabled` selector to your style with
    `display: none`.
  - If you are using `classNames`, add a `navButtonInteractionDisabled` to your
    `classNames` with `display: none` to hide the buttons.

- Improved rendering performance using `shouldComponentUpdate` and
  `PureComponent` ([#389](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/389))

  It should not be a breaking change, but if something is not working for you
  when updating some props please file an issue 🙃

**Improvements**

- Allow `{after, before}` modifiers in the same object
  ([#354](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/354)). You can now
  write before/after modifiers such as `disabledDays={ { before: aDate, after: aDate }}`.
- **DayPickerInput**: added
  [`clickUnselectsDay`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-input.html#clickunselectsday)
  prop to unselect and clear the input when clicking on a previously selected
  day ([#399](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/399))

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed an issue where users were able to focus outside days
  ([#400](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/400) by
  [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))
- Fixed an issue with Internet Explorer 11
  ([#403](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/403) by
  [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))
- **a11y**: fixed a warning `You have an unlabeled element or control.` shown
  with react-a11y ([#386](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/386))
- **DayPickerInput**: fixed an issue when updating the `month`'s
  `dayPickerProps` value
  ([#380](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/380) by
  [Yustynn](https://github.com/Yustynn))

**Improvements in the built version**

These changes applies to the production build from the `lib` dir (e.g. that
served from unpkg.com).

- Removed prop types from production build
  ([#349](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/349))
- Include `DayPicker.Input` in the built file
  ([#383](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/383))

  Use `<DayPicker.Input />` to render the input component.

## v5.5.3

_Release date: 2017-05-25_

- Bugfix for `DayPickerInput`: updated `value` prop now will be reflected in the
  component's state
  ([#363](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/363))

## v5.5.0

_Release Date: 2017-05-09_

**New DayPickerInput component**

Use the `DayPickerInput` component to render an input field interacting with the
day picker ([#213](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/213)).

See [example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/input.html),
[docs](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/input.html) and
[API reference](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-input.html).

**New features**

- New
  [`todayButton`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#todaybutton)
  prop ([#329](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/329)).

  Use this prop to display a button on the calendar's footer to switch to the
  current month
  ([example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/customization-today-button.html)).

- New
  [`showWeekDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#showweekdays)
  and
  [`onWeekClick`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#onweekclick)
  props ([#304](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/304)).

  Use this props to display and interact with the year's week numbers
  ([example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/customization-week-numbers.html)).

- New `daysOfWeek`
  [modifiers type](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/modifiers.html) to match
  days of the weeks
  ([#330](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/330)).

  For example, to match Sundays and Mondays:

  ```diff
  <DayPicker
    disabledDays={
  -    day => day.getDate() === 0 || day.getDate() === 1
  +    daysOfWeek: [0, 1]
    }
  />
  ```

## v5.4.3

_Release date: 2017-05-06_

- Bugfix: `isBeforeDay`/`isAfterDay` functions where not exported correctly
  ([#327](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/327))

## v5.4.2

_Release date: 2017-05-03_

- Bugfix: `aria` role in Week element
  ([#322](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/322) by
  [emily-plummer](https://github.com/emily-plummer))

## v5.4.1

_Release Date: 2017-04-29_

- Expose [ModifiersUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/ModifiersUtils.html)
  functions ([#309](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/309) by
  [cwmoo740](https://github.com/cwmoo740))

  Use this set of functions if you need to validate or test your modifiers.

## v5.3.0

_Release Date: 2017-04-25_

- Include Typescript Type Definitions
  ([#303](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/303))
- Added: a new
  [`modifiersStyles`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#modifiersstyles)
  prop to add inline style to the days matching the given modifiers (see
  [`example`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#modifiersstyles)).
- Added: `isDayBefore`, `isDayAfter` functions to
  [DateUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/DateUtils.html).

**Bug fixes**

- Functions were not considered in arrays of modifiers
  ([#301](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/301))
- Fixes possible issues when comparing days with different timezones
  ([#307](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/307))

## v5.2.3

_Release date: 2017-04-14_

- Fixed `PropTypes` warnings in React 15.5.

## v5.2.0

_Release Date: 2017-03-09_

- Allow overriding `today` modifier
  ([#279](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/279) by
  [maxdubrinsky](https://github.com/maxdubrinsky))
- Pass React Components to
  [`navBarElement`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#navBarElement),
  [`captionElement`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#captionElement),
  [`weekdayElement`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#weekdayElement)
  ([#280](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/280) by
  [cwmoo740](https://github.com/cwmoo740))

- Fixed `aria` roles for weekdays and months HTML elements
  ([#276](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/276) by
  [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))

## v5.1.2

_Release date: 2017-03-03_

- Fixed: an issue with keyboard navigation when using `classNames` prop
  ([#269](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/269) by
  [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan),
  [#275](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/275))
- Fixed: installation issue with bower

## v5.1.1

_Release Date: 2017-03-03_

- New
  [`classNames`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#classnames)
  prop ([#264](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/264)).

  Use this prop to change the CSS class names or add support for CSS modules
  ([#73](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/73), see
  [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/css-modules.html)).

- New [`month`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#month)
  prop ([#263](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/263)).

  This differs from the `initialMonth` props as it causes the calendar to
  re-render when its value changes.

- Added: `aria-label` attributes to the navigation bar with the new
  [`labels`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#labels) prop
  ([#258](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/258)).

## v5.0.0

\_Release Date: 2017-02-14

This release focuses on improving perfomance and the component's api-daypicker.

- **New modifiers value types**
  ([#254](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/254))

  Use dates, arrays, or ranges as modifier types, not just functions:

  ```diff
  <DayPicker
  -     selectedDays={ day => DateUtils.isSameDay(day, this.state.selectedDay)}
  +     selectedDays={ this.state.selectedDay }
  />
  ```

  Read more in the
  [modifiers documentation](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/modifiers.html).

- **Breaking change** Event handlers signature has changed
  ([#256](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/256))

  All events handlers like `onDayClick`, `onCaptionClick`, etc. now receive the
  Syntethic Event as last argument. Thus you must change your event handlers as
  follow:

  ```diff
  onDayClick={
  - (e, day, modifiers) => {
  + (day, modifiers, e)
      e.preventDefault();
      console.log(day);
      console.log(modifiers);
    }
  }
  ```

- **Breaking change** Use
  [`containerProps`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#containerprops)
  to pass props to the container `div` element. Before, any prop was passed to
  the container element degrading performance
  ([#255](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/255)):

  ```diff
  <DayPicker
  -    data-thing="foo"
  +    containerProps={ 'data-thing': 'foo' }
  />
  ```

## v4.0.0

\_Release Date: 2017-02-10

- Pass the day's modifiers to the `renderDay` prop function
  ([#237](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/237))

- **Breaking change** Updating `initialMonth` will not show anymore a different
  month after the first mount
  ([#169](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/169))

  If you need the calendar to display a different month, use the
  [`month`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#month) prop.

- **Breaking change** Use `lang` HTML attribute instead of a specific CSS class
  name.

  This change may break your style or layout if you are styling the component
  according to the current locale. If this is the case, change your CSS to use
  the `lang` attribute selector. For examples, if you are styling the calendar
  for the `de` locale:

  ```diff
  - .DayPicker--de {
  + .DayPicker[lang="de"] {
    background: yellow;
  }
  ```

## v3.1.1

_Release date: 2016-10-18_

- Fixed [an issue](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/227) with IE
  and older Safari.

## v3.1.0

_Release Date: 2016-10-14_

- New `months`, `weekdaysLong`, `weekdaysShort`, `firstDayOfWeek` props to
  localize the component.

**Easier localization**

With these new props you can localize the Day Picker in a more declarative way.
Check out [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/?localized).

## v3.0.1

_Release date: 2016-10-14_

- Fixed [a bug](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/224) with
  MomentLocaleUtils.

## v3.0.0

\_Release Date: 2016-10-11

- Fixed [an issue](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/207) with
  weekdays labels ([#220](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/220) by
  [makenosound](https://github.com/makenosound)).
- Removed `weekdayComponent` and `navbarComponent` props (deprecated from
  [v2.3.0](#v230-2016-06-30))

**Breaking changes**

For any locale, weekday names must now begin from Sunday, and the first day of
week should reflect this change (hence to start from Monday, the first day of
week is `1`). See this
[diff](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/commit/e1462b3818e0a56c24cbcdeb9dba52da8cd8ff72?diff=unified)
as example.

## v2.5.0

- Improved behavior of `initialMonth`
  ([#198](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/198) by
  [zaygraveyard](https://github.com/zaygraveyard)).

_Release date: 2016-07-01_

Removed superfluous deprecation warnings.

## v2.3.0

_Release Date: 2016-06-30_

  ([#179](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/179) by
  [boatkorachal](https://github.com/boatkorachal)).
- Added `onDayFocus` prop
  ([#185](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/185) by
  [johannesd](https://github.com/johannesd)).

**Deprecation notice**

`navbarComponent` and `weekdayComponent` props are deprecated. Please use
`navbarElement` and `weekdayElement`:

```diff
- <DayPicker navbarComponent={ MyCustomNavbar } weekdayComponent={ MyCustomWeekday } />
+ <DayPicker navbarElement={ <MyCustomNavbar/> } weekdayElement={ <MyCustomWeekday /> } />
```

## v2.2.0

_Release Date: 2016-06-09_

Added `fixedWeeks` prop
([#176](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/176) by
[fcsonline](https://github.com/fcsonline)). Use this prop to always display 6
weeks per month: [example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/?fixedWeeks).

## v2.1.1

_Release date: 2016-06-06_

Fixed compatibility with IE11
([#175](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/175) by
[davidspiess](https://github.com/davidspiess)).

## v2.1.0

_Release Date: 2016-06-02_

- Added
  [`weekdayComponent`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#weekdaycomponent-component)
  prop ([#172](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/172) by
  [stanislav-ermakov-roi](https://github.com/stanislav-ermakov-roi)). Use this
  prop to use a custom component for rendering the weekday cells in the header.
- Added
  [`navbarComponent`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#navbarcomponent-component)
  prop ([#173](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/173) by
  [stanislav-ermakov-roi](https://github.com/stanislav-ermakov-roi)). Use this
  prop to use a custom component for rendering the navigation bar.

## v2.0.3

_Release date: 2016-05-24_

Included the dist version in the npm package.

## v2.0.2

_Release date: 2016-05-24_

Fixed a bug when `canChangeMonth` is set to `true`
([\#168](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/168)).

## v2.0.1

_Release date: 2016-05-15_

Fix npm release.

## v2.0.0

_Release Date: 2016-05-15_

This release mainly improves the component’s API (thus some breaking changes)
and add some new props.

Code has been split in multiple components and tests have been rewritten with
[enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme). It should be easier to add and test
the upcoming new features!

Thanks everyone for the support and for the help on making this component better
🤗 If you have issues or suggestions, don't forget the
[Gitter room](https://gitter.im/gpbl/react-day-picker)!

**Breaking changes**

- The `onDay*` event handlers receive as third argument an object of modifiers
  instead of an array.

This mean that if you where writing:

```js
onDayClick(e, day, modifiers) {
  if (modifiers.indexOf('selected') > -1) {
    console.log('This day is selected')
  }
}
```

you must now write:

```js
onDayClick(e, day, modifiers) {
  if (modifiers.selected === true) {
    console.log('This day is selected')
  }
}
```

or better:

```js
onDayClick(e, day, { selected }) {
  if (selected) {
    console.log('This day is selected')
  }
}
```

- Removed `onDayTouchTap`. Use `onDayClick` instead. If you need more
  granularity over touch events, you can use the new `onDayTouchStart` and
  `onDayTouchEnd` props. See
  [#153](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/153) for more details.

- Fixed import with CommonJS modules
  ([#136](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/136)).

This affects code using `require('react-day-picker').default` or similar syntax,
which was required for v1.3.0. Now you can `require('react-day-picker')` as
usual, i.e. without specifying `default`. If you are using ES2015 modules
`import DayPicker from 'react-day-picker'`, this change shouldn't affect you.

- New `formatDay` function in
  [LocaleUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/utils-locale.html).

If you are using your
[custom LocaleUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#advanced)
to localize the calendar, you need to implement this function as well, which is
required to format the newly added
[aria-label attribute](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/132) (see
the
[documentation](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#advanced)
for an example). If you are localizing
[using moment](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#moment),
this change shouldn't affect you.

**New props**

- New
  [`disabledDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#disabledays-prop)
  and
  [`selectedDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#disabledays-prop)
  props. They receive a function `(day) => Bool` as value to easily define which
  day should have the `selected` or `disabled` modifiers. See
  [#34](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/34) for more details.

  So if you were writing something like:

  ```jsx
  <DayPicker
    modifiers={
      ({ selected: (day) => isDaySelected(day) },
      { disabled: (day) => isDayDisabled(day) })
    }
  />
  ```

  now you can write:

  ```jsx
  <DayPicker
    selectedDays={(day) => isDaySelected(day)}
    disabledDays={(day) => isDayDisabled(day)}
  />
  ```

  with native `Date` object. To localize the Day Picker with moment.js (or
  another library), follow [this page](http://react-day-picker.js.org/#tips)
- Class names have been updated (objects are now CamelCase). As example, please
  see
  [the updated CSS file](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/master/site/src/style/DayPicker.scss).
- [#27] All rendered tags are now `div` or `span`. Use CSS to style the
  daypicker as table.
- A `today` modifier is added automatically
- Event handlers receive the event as first argument. For example:
  `onDayClick(e, day, modifiers)` instead of `onDayClick(day, modifiers, e)`
- `onNextMonthClick` and `onNextMonthClick` props have been removed. Use
  `onMonthChange` instead.
