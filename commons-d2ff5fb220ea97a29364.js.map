\"Formatting\" units (e.g. formatting quarter) in the default en-US locale\n\t *    are the same as \"stand-alone\" units, but are different in some languages.\n\t *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n\t *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular:\n\t *\n\t *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n\t *\n\t *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n\t *\n\t * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n\t *    the single quote characters (see below).\n\t *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table (e.g. `EEEEEEEEEEE`)\n\t *    the output will be the same as default pattern for this unit, usually\n\t *    the longest one (in case of ISO weekdays, `EEEE`). Default patterns for units\n\t *    are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n\t *\n\t *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMM') //=> 'Nov'`\n\t *\n\t *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMM') //=> 'November'`\n\t *\n\t *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMM') //=> 'N'`\n\t *\n\t *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n\t *\n\t *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n\t *\n\t * 3. Some patterns could be unlimited length (such as `yyyyyyyy`).\n\t *    The output will be padded with zeros to match the length of the pattern.\n\t *\n\t *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'yyyyyyyy') //=> '00002017'`\n\t *\n\t * 4. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n\t *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n\t *\n\t * 5. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n\t *\n\t *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n\t *    |------|-----|-----|\n\t *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n\t *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n\t *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n\t *\n\t *    Also `yy` always returns the last two digits of a year,\n\t *    while `uu` pads single digit years to 2 characters and returns other years unchanged:\n\t *\n\t *    | Year | `yy` | `uu` |\n\t *    |------|------|------|\n\t *    | 1    |   01 |   01 |\n\t *    | 14   |   14 |   14 |\n\t *    | 376  |   76 |  376 |\n\t *    | 1453 |   53 | 1453 |\n\t *\n\t *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n\t *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n\t *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [getISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getISOWeekYear}\n\t *    and [getWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeekYear}).\n\t *\n\t * 6. Specific non-location timezones are currently unavailable in `date-fns`,\n\t *    so right now these tokens fall back to GMT timezones.\n\t *\n\t * 7. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n\t *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n\t *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n\t *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n\t *    - `t`: seconds timestamp\n\t *    - `T`: milliseconds timestamp\n\t *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n\t *    - `P`: long localized date\n\t *    - `p`: long localized time\n\t *\n\t * 8. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\n\t *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n\t *\n\t * 9. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.\n\t *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n\t *\n\t * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n\t *\n\t * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n\t *\n\t * - The second argument is now required for the sake of explicitness.\n\t *\n\t *   ```javascript\n\t *   // Before v2.0.0\n\t *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1))\n\t *\n\t *   // v2.0.0 onward\n\t *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1), \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSxxx\")\n\t *   ```\n\t *\n\t * - New format string API for `format` function\n\t *   which is based on [Unicode Technical Standard #35](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).\n\t *   See [this post](https://blog.date-fns.org/post/unicode-tokens-in-date-fns-v2-sreatyki91jg) for more details.\n\t *\n\t * - Characters are now escaped using single quote symbols (`'`) instead of square brackets.\n\t *\n\t * @param {Date|Number} date - the original date\n\t * @param {String} format - the string of tokens\n\t * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n\t * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object.

from string using the given format string.\n\t *\n\t * > ⚠️ Please note that the `format` tokens differ from Moment.js and other libraries.\n\t * > See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n\t *\n\t * The characters in the format string wrapped between two single quotes characters (') are escaped.\n\t * Two single quotes in a row, whether inside or outside a quoted sequence, represent a 'real' single quote.\n\t *\n\t * Format of the format string is based on Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n\t * https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table\n\t * with a few additions (see note 5 below the table).\n\t *\n\t * Not all tokens are compatible. Combinations that don't make sense or could lead to bugs are prohibited\n\t * and will throw `RangeError`. For example usage of 24-hour format token with AM/PM token will throw an exception:\n\t *\n\t * ```javascript\n\t * parse('23 AM', 'HH a', new Date())\n\t * //=> RangeError: The format string mustn't contain `HH` and `a` at the same time\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * See the compatibility table:

\"stand-alone\" units, but are different in some languages.\n\t *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n\t *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular.\n\t *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:\n\t *\n\t *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n\t *\n\t *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n\t *\n\t *    `parse` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangably.\n\t *\n\t * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n\t *    the single quote characters (see below).\n\t *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:\n\t *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `parse` will try to match a number\n\t *      as wide as the sequence\n\t *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `parse` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.\n\t *      These variations are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n\t *\n\t * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n\t *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n\t *\n\t * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n\t *\n\t *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n\t *    |------|-----|-----|\n\t *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n\t *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n\t *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n\t *\n\t *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `referenceDate`:\n\t *\n\t *    `parse('50', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 2050 00:00:00`\n\t *\n\t *    `parse('75', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Wed Jan 01 1975 00:00:00`\n\t *\n\t *    while `uu` will just assign the year as is:\n\t *\n\t *    `parse('50', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 0050 00:00:00`\n\t *\n\t *    `parse('75', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Tue Jan 01 0075 00:00:00`\n\t *\n\t *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n\t *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n\t *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear}\n\t *    and [setWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear}).\n\t *\n\t * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n\t *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n\t *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n\t *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n\t *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n\t *    - `P`: long localized date\n\t *    - `p`: long localized time\n\t *\n\t * 6. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\n\t *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n\t *\n\t * 7. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.\n\t *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n\t *\n\t * 8. `P+` tokens do not have a defined priority since they are merely aliases to other tokens based\n\t *    on the given locale.\n\t *\n\t *    using `en-US` locale: `P` => `MM/dd/yyyy`\n\t *    using `en-US` locale: `p` => `hh:mm a`\n\t *    using `pt-BR` locale: `P` => `dd/MM/yyyy`\n\t *    using `pt-BR` locale: `p` => `HH:mm`\n\t *\n\t * Values will be assigned to the date in the descending order of its unit's priority.\n\t * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.\n\t *\n\t * If no values of higher priority are parsed (e.g. when parsing string 'January 1st' without a year),\n\t * the values will be taken from 3rd argument `referenceDate` which works as a context of parsing.\n\t *\n\t * `referenceDate` must be passed for correct work of the function.\n\t * If you're not sure which `referenceDate` to supply, create a new instance of Date:\n\t * `parse('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy', new Date())`\n\t * In this case parsing will be done in the context of the current date.\n\t * If `referenceDate` is `Invalid Date` or a value not convertible to valid `Date`,\n\t * then `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n\t *\n\t * The result may vary by locale.\n\t *\n\t * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `referenceDate` will be returned.\n\t *\n\t * If parsing failed, `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n\t * Invalid Date is a Date, whose time value is NaN.\n\t * Time value of Date: http://es5.github.io/#x15.9.1.1\n\t *\n\t * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n\t *\n\t * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n\t *\n\t * - Old `parse` was renamed to `toDate`.\n\t *   Now `parse` is a new function which parses a string using a provided format.\n\t *\n\t *   ```javascript\n\t *   // Before v2.0.0\n\t *   parse('2016-01-01')\n\t *\n\t *   // v2.0.0 onward\n\t *   toDate('2016-01-01')\n\t *   parse('2016-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd', new Date())\n\t *   ```\n\t *\n\t * @param {String} dateString - the string to parse\n\t * @param {String} formatString - the string of tokens\n\t * @param {Date|Number} referenceDate - defines values missing from the parsed dateString\n\t * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n\t * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object.

\"stand-alone\" units, but are different in some languages.\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular:\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n *\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table (e.g. `EEEEEEEEEEE`)\n *    the output will be the same as default pattern for this unit, usually\n *    the longest one (in case of ISO weekdays, `EEEE`). Default patterns for units\n *    are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMM') //=> 'Nov'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMM') //=> 'N'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n * 3. Some patterns could be unlimited length (such as `yyyyyyyy`).\n *    The output will be padded with zeros to match the length of the pattern.\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'yyyyyyyy') //=> '00002017'`\n *\n * 4. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n *\n * 5. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n *\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n *    |------|-----|-----|\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n *\n *    Also `yy` always returns the last two digits of a year,\n *    while `uu` pads single digit years to 2 characters and returns other years unchanged:\n *\n *    | Year | `yy` | `uu` |\n *    |------|------|------|\n *    | 1    |   01 |   01 |\n *    | 14   |   14 |   14 |\n *    | 376  |   76 |  376 |\n *    | 1453 |   53 | 1453 |\n *\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [getISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getISOWeekYear}\n *    and [getWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeekYear}).\n *\n * 6. Specific non-location timezones are currently unavailable in `date-fns`,\n *    so right now these tokens fall back to GMT timezones.\n *\n * 7. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n *    - `t`: seconds timestamp\n *    - `T`: milliseconds timestamp\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n *    - `P`: long localized date\n *    - `p`: long localized time\n *\n * 8. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 9. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n *\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n *\n * - The second argument is now required for the sake of explicitness.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   // Before v2.0.0\n *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1))\n *\n *   // v2.0.0 onward\n *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1), \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSxxx\")\n *   ```\n *\n * - New format string API for `format` function\n *   which is based on [Unicode Technical Standard #35](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).\n *   See [this post](https://blog.date-fns.org/post/unicode-tokens-in-date-fns-v2-sreatyki91jg) for more details.\n *\n * - Characters are now escaped using single quote symbols (`'`) instead of square brackets.\n *\n * @param {Date|Number} date - the original date\n * @param {String} format - the string of tokens\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object.

the date.\n *\n * @description\n * Return the date parsed from string using the given format string.\n *\n * > ⚠️ Please note that the `format` tokens differ from Moment.js and other libraries.\n * > See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * The characters in the format string wrapped between two single quotes characters (') are escaped.\n * Two single quotes in a row, whether inside or outside a quoted sequence, represent a 'real' single quote.\n *\n * Format of the format string is based on Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n * https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table\n * with a few additions (see note 5 below the table).\n *\n * Not all tokens are compatible. Combinations that don't make sense or could lead to bugs are prohibited\n * and will throw `RangeError`. For example usage of 24-hour format token with AM/PM token will throw an exception:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * parse('23 AM', 'HH a', new Date())\n * //=> RangeError: The format string mustn't contain `HH` and `a` at the same time\n * ```\n *\n * See the compatibility table: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQOPU3xUhplll6dyoMmVUXHKl_8CRDs6_ueLmex3SoqwhuolkuN3O05l4rqx5h1dKX8eb46Ul-CCSrq/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true\n *\n * Accepted format string patterns:\n * |

but are different in some languages.\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular.\n *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n *\n *    `parse` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangably.\n *\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:\n *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `parse` will try to match a number\n *      as wide as the sequence\n *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `parse` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.\n *      These variations are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n *\n * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n *\n * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n *\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n *    |------|-----|-----|\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n *\n *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `referenceDate`:\n *\n *    `parse('50', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 2050 00:00:00`\n *\n *    `parse('75', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Wed Jan 01 1975 00:00:00`\n *\n *    while `uu` will just assign the year as is:\n *\n *    `parse('50', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 0050 00:00:00`\n *\n *    `parse('75', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Tue Jan 01 0075 00:00:00`\n *\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear}\n *    and [setWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear}).\n *\n * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n *    - `P`: long localized date\n *    - `p`: long localized time\n *\n * 6. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 7. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 8. `P+` tokens do not have a defined priority since they are merely aliases to other tokens based\n *    on the given locale.\n *\n *    using `en-US` locale: `P` => `MM/dd/yyyy`\n *    using `en-US` locale: `p` => `hh:mm a`\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `P` => `dd/MM/yyyy`\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `p` => `HH:mm`\n *\n * Values will be assigned to the date in the descending order of its unit's priority.\n * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.\n *\n * If no values of higher priority are parsed (e.g. when parsing string 'January 1st' without a year),\n * the values will be taken from 3rd argument `referenceDate` which works as a context of parsing.\n *\n * `referenceDate` must be passed for correct work of the function.\n * If you're not sure which `referenceDate` to supply, create a new instance of Date:\n * `parse('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy', new Date())`\n * In this case parsing will be done in the context of the current date.\n * If `referenceDate` is `Invalid Date` or a value not convertible to valid `Date`,\n * then `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n *\n * The result may vary by locale.\n *\n * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `referenceDate` will be returned.\n *\n * If parsing failed, `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n * Invalid Date is a Date, whose time value is NaN.\n * Time value of Date: http://es5.github.io/#x15.9.1.1\n *\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n *\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n *\n * - Old `parse` was renamed to `toDate`.\n *   Now `parse` is a new function which parses a string using a provided format.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   // Before v2.0.0\n *   parse('2016-01-01')\n *\n *   // v2.0.0 onward\n *   toDate('2016-01-01')\n *   parse('2016-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd', new Date())\n *   ```\n *\n * @param {String} dateString - the string to parse\n * @param {String} formatString - the string of tokens\n * @param {Date|Number} referenceDate - defines values missing from the parsed dateString\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object. See [Locale]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/Locale}\n * @param {0|1|2|3|4|5|6} [options.weekStartsOn=0] - the index of the first day of the week (0 - Sunday)\n * @param {1|2|3|4|5|6|7} [options.firstWeekContainsDate=1] - the day of January, which is always in the first week of the year\n * @param {Boolean} [options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens=false] - if true, allows usage of the week-numbering year tokens `YY` and `YYYY`;\n *   see: https://git.io/fxCyr\n * @param {Boolean} [options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens=false] - if true, allows usage of the day of year tokens `D` and `DD`;\n *   see: https://git.io/fxCyr\n * @returns {Date} the parsed date\n * @throws {TypeError} 3 arguments required\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.weekStartsOn` must be between 0 and 6\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.firstWeekContainsDate` must be between 1 and 7\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.locale` must contain `match` property\n * @throws {RangeError} use `yyyy` instead of `YYYY` for formatting years;
