- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) - for the documentation website
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - for the examples app
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - for unit tests

git clone https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker.git
cd react-day-picker
pnpm install
```

### DayPicker Workspace

If your are using [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com) open the [react-day-picker.code-workspace](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/main/react-day-picker.code-workspace) to set up the development environment. This workspace includes:

- Suggested extensions for the project
- TypeScript compiler running in watch mode for the ESM export
- Docusaurus website running at http://localhost:2001, with documentation and API docs
- Vite.js examples app served at http://localhost:5173
  - Use this app to run isolated test cases and examples, exported by `/examples/index.ts`

### Test Driven Development

DayPicker development is test-driven. Change code and run the tests using `pnpm run test-watch` or `pnpm run test`. The Jest plugin in the VS Code workspace is recommended for running tests.

### Useful Scripts

- To run the build in watch mode:
  ```sh
  pnpm tsc --project tsconfig-esm.json --watch
  ```
- To run the tests in watch mode:
  ```
  pnpm run test-watch
  ```
- To run the examples app at http://localhost:5173
  ```
  pnpm --filter examples-app run dev
  ```
- To run the documentation at http://localhost:2001:
  ```
  pnpm --filter website run start
  ```
