([#423](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/423))\n* `DayPickerInput` Fixed: shown month was not updated when updating month in `dayPickerProps` ([#425](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/425))\n\n# [v6.0.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v6.0.0) (2017-06-16)\n\nThis major release focuses on performance, improves accessibility and fixes some bugs. There are some possible breaking changes, but they are easy to fix (read below).\n\n**Breaking changes**\n\n* The container's HTML structure has changed: the interactive element used to focus the calendar has been moved into a wrapper to improve accessibility ([#392](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/392)):\n  \n  ```diff\n  <div className=\"DayPicker\">\n  + <div className=\"DayPicker-wrapper\">\n    <!-- rendered stuff here -->\n  + </div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n  \n  This is a **breaking change** if you are styling the component using your own CSS or with the `classNames` prop.\n  \n  * If you are styling with your own stylesheet, rename your `.DayPicker` selector to `.DayPicker-wrapper`:\n  \n  ```diff\n  - .DayPicker {\n  + .DayPicker-wrapper {\n  ```\n  \n  * If you are using `classNames` with the `container` prop, rename the `container` className to `wrapper`.\n\n* The container element is now an `inline-block` element.\n\n* When using `fromMonth`/`toMonth` props, navigation buttons now are rendered and hidden via CSS. Before, the buttons were not rendered at all, and it was impossible to style them ([#366](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/366))\n\n  This is a **breaking change** if you are using those props and styling the component using your own CSS or with the `classNames` prop. \n  \n  In such cases, the buttons will be always shown even if the previous or the next months are not navigable. \n\n  * If you are styling with your own stylesheet, add a `.DayPicker-NavButton--interactionDisabled` selector to your style with `display: none`.\n  * If you are using `classNames`, add a `navButtonInteractionDisabled` to your `classNames` with `display: none` to hide the buttons.\n\n* Improved rendering performance using `shouldComponentUpdate` and `PureComponent` ([#389](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/389))\n\n  It should not be a breaking change, but if something is not working for you when updating some props please file an issue 🙃\n\n**Improvements**\n\n* Allow `{after, before}` modifiers in the same object ([#354](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/354)). You can now write before/after modifiers such as `disabledDays={ { before: aDate, after: aDate }}`.\n* **DayPickerInput**: added [`clickUnselectsDay`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-input.html#clickunselectsday) prop to unselect and clear the input when clicking on a previously selected day ([#399](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/399))\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Fixed an issue where users were able to focus outside days ([#400](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/400) by [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))\n* Fixed an issue with Internet Explorer 11 ([#403](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/403) by [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))\n* **a11y**: fixed a warning  `You have an unlabeled element or control.` shown with react-a11y ([#386](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/386))\n* **DayPickerInput**: fixed an issue when updating the `month`'s `dayPickerProps` value ([#380](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/380) by [Yustynn](https://github.com/Yustynn))\n\n**Improvements in the built version**\n\nThese changes applies to the production build from the `lib` dir (e.g. that served from unpkg.com). \n\n* Removed prop types from production build ([#349](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/349))\n* Include `DayPicker.Input` in the built file ([#383](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/383))\n\n  Use `<DayPicker.Input />` to render the input component.\n\n---\n\n### [v5.5.3](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.5.3) (2017-05-25)\n\n* Bugfix for `DayPickerInput`: updated `value` prop now will be reflected in the component's state ([#363](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/363))\n\n## [v5.5.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.5.0) (2017-05-09)\n\n**New DayPickerInput component**\n\nUse the `DayPickerInput` component to render an input field interacting with the day picker ([#213](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/213)).\n\nSee [example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/input.html), [docs](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/input.html) and [API reference](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-input.html).\n\n**New features**\n\n* New [`todayButton`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#todaybutton) prop ([#329](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/329)).\n\n  Use this prop to display a button on the calendar's footer to switch to the current month ([example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/customization-today-button.html)).\n\n* New [`showWeekDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#showweekdays) and [`onWeekClick`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#onweekclick) props  ([#304](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/304)).\n\n  Use this props to display and interact with the year's week numbers ([example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/customization-week-numbers.html)).\n\n* New `daysOfWeek` [modifiers type](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/modifiers.html) to match days of the weeks ([#330](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/330)).\n\n  For example, to match Sundays and Mondays:\n\n  ```diff\n  <DayPicker \n    disabledDays={\n  -    day => day.getDate() === 0 || day.getDate() === 1\n  +    daysOfWeek: [0, 1]\n    }\n  />\n  ```\n\n### [v5.4.3](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.4.3) (2017-05-06)\n\n* Bugfix: `isBeforeDay`/`isAfterDay` functions where not exported correctly ([#327](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/327))\n\n### [v5.4.2](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.4.2) (2017-05-03)\n\n* Bugfix: `aria` role in Week element ([#322](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/322) by [emily-plummer](https://github.com/emily-plummer))\n\n## [v5.4.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.4.1) (2017-04-29)\n\n* Expose [ModifiersUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/ModifiersUtils.html) functions ([#309](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/309) by [cwmoo740](https://github.com/cwmoo740))\n\n  Use this set of functions if you need to validate or test your modifiers.\n\n## [v5.3.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.3.0) (2017-04-25)\n\n* Include Typescript Type Definitions ([#303](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/303))\n* Add a new [`modifiersStyles`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#modifiersstyles) prop to add inline style to the days matching the given modifiers (see [`example`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#modifiersstyles)).\n* Add `isDayBefore`, `isDayAfter` functions to [DateUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/DateUtils.html).\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Functions were not considered in arrays of modifiers ([#301](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/301))\n* Fixes possible issues when comparing days with different timezones ([#307](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/307))\n\n### [v5.2.3](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.2.3) (2017-04-14)\n\n* Fixed `PropTypes` warnings in React 15.5.\n\n## [v5.2.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.2.0) (2017-03-09)\n\n* Allow overriding `today` modifier ([#279](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/279) by [maxdubrinsky](https://github.com/maxdubrinsky))\n* Pass React Components to [`navBarElement`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#navBarElement), [`captionElement`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#captionElement), [`weekdayElement`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#weekdayElement) ([#280](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/280) by [cwmoo740](https://github.com/cwmoo740))\n\n* Fixed `aria` roles for weekdays and months HTML elements ([#276](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/276) by [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan))\n\n### [v5.1.2](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.1.2) (2017-03-03)\n\n* Fix an issue with keyboard navigation when using `classNames` prop ([#269](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/269) by [oigewan](https://github.com/oigewan), [#275](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/275))\n* Fix installation issue with bower \n\n## [v5.1.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.1.1) (2017-03-03)\n\n* New [`classNames`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#classnames) prop ([#264](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/264)). \n  \n  Use this prop to change the CSS class names or add support for CSS modules ([#73](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/73), see [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/css-modules.html)). \n\n* New [`month`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#month) prop ([#263](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/263)).\n  \n  This differs from the `initialMonth` props as it causes the calendar to re-render when its value changes. \n\n* Add `aria-label` attributes to the navigation bar with the new [`labels`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#labels) prop ([#258](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/258)).\n\n# [v5.0.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v5.0.0) (2017-02-14)\n\nThis release focuses on improving perfomance and the component's api-daypicker.\n\n* **New modifiers value types** ([#254](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/254))\n\n  Use dates, arrays, or ranges as modifier types, not just functions:\n\n  ```diff\n  <DayPicker \n  -     selectedDays={ day => DateUtils.isSameDay(day, this.state.selectedDay)}\n  +     selectedDays={ this.state.selectedDay }\n  />\n  ```\n\n  Read more in the [modifiers documentation](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/modifiers.html).\n\n* **Breaking change** Event handlers signature has changed ([#256](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/256))\n\n  All events handlers like `onDayClick`, `onCaptionClick`, etc. now receive the Syntethic Event as last argument. Thus you must change your event handlers as follow:\n\n  ```diff\n  onDayClick={\n  - (e, day, modifiers) => {\n  + (day, modifiers, e)\n      e.preventDefault();\n      console.log(day);\n      console.log(modifiers);\n    }\n  }\n\n  ```\n\n* **Breaking change** Use [`containerProps`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#containerprops) to pass props to the container `div` element. Before, any prop was passed to the container element degrading performance ([#255](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/255)):\n\n  ```diff\n  <DayPicker \n  -    data-thing=\"foo\" \n  +    containerProps={ 'data-thing': 'foo' }\n  />\n  ```\n\n---\n\n# [v4.0.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v4.0.0) (2017-02-10)\n* Pass the day's modifiers to the `renderDay` prop function ([#237](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/237))\n\n* **Breaking change** Updating `initialMonth` will not show anymore a different month after the first mount ([#169](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/169))\n\n  If you need the calendar to display a different month, use the [`month`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#month) prop.\n\n* **Breaking change** Use `lang` HTML attribute instead of a specific CSS class name.\n\n  This change may break your style or layout if you are styling the component according to the current locale. \n  If this is the case, change your CSS to use the `lang` attribute selector. For examples,\n  if you are styling the calendar for the `de` locale:\n\n  ```diff\n  - .DayPicker--de {\n  + .DayPicker[lang=\"de\"] {\n    background: yellow;\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### [v3.1.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v3.1.1) (2016-10-18)\n\n* Fixed [an issue](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/227) with IE and older Safari.\n\n## [v3.1.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v3.1.0) (2016-10-14)\n\n* New `months`, `weekdaysLong`, `weekdaysShort`, `firstDayOfWeek` props to localize the component.\n\n**Easier localization** \n\nWith these new props you can localize the Day Picker in a more declarative way. Check out [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/?localized).\n\n---\n\n### [v3.0.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v3.0.1) (2016-10-14)\n\n* Fixed [a bug](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/224) with MomentLocaleUtils. \n\n# [v3.0.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v3.0.0) (2016-10-11)\n\n* Fixed [an issue](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/207) with weekdays labels ([#220](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/220) by [makenosound](https://github.com/makenosound)).\n* Removed `weekdayComponent` and `navbarComponent` props (deprecated from [v2.3.0](#v230-2016-06-30)) \n\n**Breaking changes**\n\nFor any locale, weekday names must now begin from Sunday, and the first day of week should reflect this change (hence to start from Monday, the first day of week is `1`). See this [diff](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/commit/e1462b3818e0a56c24cbcdeb9dba52da8cd8ff72?diff=unified) as example.\n  \n---\n\n## [v2.5.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.5.0) (2016-10-06)\n\n* Build dist files as UMD module ([#216](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/216) by [pguimera](https://github.com/pguimera)).\n\n## [v2.4.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.4.0) (2016-07-31)\n\n* Added `pageNavigation` prop ([#196](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/196) by [zaygraveyard](https://github.com/zaygraveyard)).\n* Improved behavior of `initialMonth` ([#198](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/198) by [zaygraveyard](https://github.com/zaygraveyard)).\n\n### [v2.3.3](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.3.3) (2016-07-04)\n\nFixed props warnings in React 15.2.0 ([#191](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/191)).\n\n### [v2.3.2](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.3.2) (2016-07-01)\n\nRemoved superfluous deprecation warnings.\n\n## [v2.3.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.3.0) (2016-06-30)\n\n* Added `navbarElement` and `weekdayElement` prop ([#179](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/179) by [boatkorachal](https://github.com/boatkorachal)).\n* Added `onDayFocus` prop ([#185](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/185) by [johannesd](https://github.com/johannesd)).\n\n**Deprecation notice**\n\n`navbarComponent` and `weekdayComponent` props are deprecated. Please use `navbarElement` and `weekdayElement`:\n\n```diff\n- <DayPicker navbarComponent={ MyCustomNavbar } weekdayComponent={ MyCustomWeekday } />\n+ <DayPicker navbarElement={ <MyCustomNavbar/> } weekdayElement={ <MyCustomWeekday /> } />\n```\n\n## [v2.2.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.2.0) (2016-06-09)\n\nAdded `fixedWeeks` prop ([#176](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/176) by [fcsonline](https://github.com/fcsonline)).\n Use this prop to always display 6 weeks per month: [example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/?fixedWeeks).\n\n### [v2.1.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.1.1) (2016-06-06)\n\nFixed compatibility with IE11 ([#175](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/175) by [davidspiess](https://github.com/davidspiess)).\n\n## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.1.0) (2016-06-02)\n\n* Added [`weekdayComponent`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#weekdaycomponent-component) prop ([#172](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/172) by [stanislav-ermakov-roi](https://github.com/stanislav-ermakov-roi)).\n Use this prop to use a custom component for rendering the weekday cells in the header.\n* Added [`navbarComponent`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#navbarcomponent-component) prop ([#173](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/173) by [stanislav-ermakov-roi](https://github.com/stanislav-ermakov-roi)).\n Use this prop to use a custom component for rendering the navigation bar.\n\n### [v2.0.3](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.0.3) (2016-05-24)\n\nIncluded the dist version in the npm package.\n\n### [v2.0.2](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.0.2) (2016-05-24)\n\nFixed a bug when `canChangeMonth` is set to `true` ([\\#168](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/168)).\n\n### [v2.0.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.0.1) (2016-05-15)\n\nFix npm release.\n\n## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.0.0) (2016-05-15)\n\nThis release mainly improves the component’s API (thus some breaking changes) and add some new props.\n\nCode has been split in multiple components and tests have been rewritten with [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme). It should be easier to add and test the upcoming new features!\n\nThanks everyone for the support and for the help on making this component better 🤗\nIf you have issues or suggestions, don't forget the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/gpbl/react-day-picker)!\n\n**Breaking changes**\n\n* The `onDay*` event handlers receive as third argument an object of modifiers instead of an array.\n\n This mean that if you where writing:\n\n ```js\n onDayClick(e, day, modifiers) {\n   if (modifiers.indexOf('selected') > -1) {\n     console.log('This day is selected')\n   }\n }\n ```\n\n you must now write:\n\n ```js\n onDayClick(e, day, modifiers) {\n   if (modifiers.selected === true) {\n     console.log('This day is selected')\n   }\n }\n ```\n\n or better:\n\n ```js\n onDayClick(e, day, { selected }) {\n   if (selected) {\n     console.log('This day is selected')\n   }\n }\n ```\n\n* Removed `onDayTouchTap`. Use `onDayClick` instead. If you need more granularity over touch events, you can use the new `onDayTouchStart` and `onDayTouchEnd` props. See [#153](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/153) for more details.\n\n* Fixed import with CommonJS modules ([#136](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/136)).\n\n This affects code using `require('react-day-picker').default` or similar syntax, which was required for v1.3.0. Now you can `require('react-day-picker')` as usual, i.e. without specifying `default`. If you are using ES2015 modules `import DayPicker from 'react-day-picker'`, this change shouldn't affect you.\n\n* New `formatDay` function in [LocaleUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/utils-locale.html).\n\n If you are using your [custom LocaleUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#advanced) to localize the calendar, you need to implement this function as well, which is required to format the newly added [aria-label attribute](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/132) (see the [documentation](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#advanced) for an example). If you are localizing [using moment](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/localization.html#moment), this change shouldn't affect you.\n\n\n**New props**\n\n* New [`disabledDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#disabledays-prop) and [`selectedDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#disabledays-prop) props. They receive a function `(day) => Bool` as value to easily define which day should have the `selected` or `disabled` modifiers. See [#34](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/34) for more details.\n\n  So if you were writing something like:\n\n  ```jsx\n  <DayPicker\n    modifiers={\n      { selected: day => isDaySelected(day) },\n      { disabled: day => isDayDisabled(day) }\n    }\n  />\n  ```\n\n  now you can write:\n\n  ```jsx\n  <DayPicker\n    selectedDays={ day => isDaySelected(day) }\n    disabledDays={ day => isDayDisabled(day) }\n  />\n  ```\n\n* Added [`reverseMonths`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#reversemonths-prop) prop to render the most recent month first. ([#147](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/141) by [sonrtomas](sonrtomas))\n* Added [`onDayKeyDown`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#ondaykeydown-prop), [`onDayTouchStart`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#ondaytouchstart-prop), [`onDayTouchEnd`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#ondaytouchend-prop) props.\n\n**Improvements**\n\n* Navigate between weeks or years using left/right or up/down arrow keys ([#132](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/132) by [limscoder](https://github.com/limscoder))\n* Added various `aria-*` attributes ([#132](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/132) by [limscoder](https://github.com/limscoder))\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Navigation with keyboard when using `fromMonth` or `endMonth`\n\n---\n\n### [v1.3.2](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.3.12) (2016-04-10)\n\nAdds React 15 to the peer dependencies.\n\n### [v1.3.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.3.1) (2016-03-02)\n\nFixes an issue causing className being overwritten by `className` prop ([\\#137](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/137)).\n\n## [v1.3.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.3.0) (2016-02-18)\n\n**Improvements**\n\n* Support for Babel 6 ([#90](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/90))\n    * See this [known issue](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/136)\n* HTML props are spread to container tag, so to support `onBlur`, `onFocus`, etc. ([#122](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/122), [#123](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/123))\n* Better RTL support for month navigation ([#125](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/125))\n\n## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.2.0) (2015-12-04)\n\n**New features**\n\n* Use a custom caption element with the new [`captionElement`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#captionelement-element) prop. A custom caption element is useful, for example, to create a year/month navigation as shown in [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/advanced-year-navigation.html). Read [#52](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/52) for a discussion about this feature.\n\n**Improvements**\n\n* Improved navigation when clicking on outside days ([#112](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/112), see also [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/months-restrict-navigation.html))\n* New `addMonths` function in [DateUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/DateUtils.html)\n* Added a style definition to package.json ([#105](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/105), thanks @webbushka)\n\n**Fixed bugs**\n\n* Make the component working again with React ~0.13 ([#108](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/108))\n* Fix a bug when clicking on outside days when `fromMonth` or `toMonth` were set ([#97](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/97))\n* Replace a wrong `attr` tag with the right `abbr` in the weekdays row – https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/33#issuecomment-159751186. ⚠️ Please note that the component may now use the CSS defined for `abbr` tags.\n\n### [v1.1.5](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.1.5) (2015-11-20)\n\nFix an issue with `showMonth()` ([#95](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/95)) – thanks @JKillian\n\n### [v1.1.4](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/1.1.4) (2015-11-19)\n\nMinor changes when importing utilities\n\n### [v1.1.3](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.1.3) (2015-11-12)\n\n**Improvements**\n\n* `isSameDay` in DateUtils now accepts `null` or `undefined` arguments\n* Added bower support\n\n### [v1.1.1](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.1.1) (2015-11-11)\n\n**Fix regression** The last version [was missing an element](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/commit/0164a38f651771c00d3b4949898937d2013c7ddd) and this change may have broken existing styles. This fix restore the original behavior adding the element again. (see [#82](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/82)).\n\n## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.1.0) (2015-11-06)\n\n**New features**\n\n* New `fromMonth` and `toMonth` props. Use the [`fromMonth`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#frommonth-date) and [`toMonth`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/api-daypicker.html#tomonth-date) props to restrict the months within which the calendar can work. See [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples/months-restrict-navigation.html).\n* `dateUtils` includes some useful function to set custom modifiers\n* `localeUtils ` are the default functions used to localize the Day Picker in english. See https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/46#issuecomment-153498039 for a sample usage of this library.\n\n### [v1.0.10](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.0.10) (2015-10-15)\n\nLet the event from next/previous month click to propagate.
