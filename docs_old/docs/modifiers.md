With _modifiers_ you change the aspect of the day cells and customize the interaction with the calendar. 

When a modifier matches a specific day, its day cells receives a modifier CSS class (as in [BEM-like syntax](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)), and its name is passed down to the event handlers.

## Type of modifiers

A modifier can be either:

- **a `Date` object**, to match a specific day
- **a `range` object** with `from` and `to` keys, to match a range of days:

  ```js
  const range = { 
    from: new Date(2015, 0, 12), 
    to: new Date(2015, 0, 16) 
  }
  ```
  will match the days between the 12th and the 16th of January.

- **an object with a `before` and/or `after` key**, to match the days before and/or after the given date:
  
  ```js
  const range = { 
    before: new Date(),
  }
  ```
  The code above will match all the past the days (i.e. the days before today).

  ```js
  const range = { 
    after: new Date(2018, 0, 1), 
  }
  ```

  The code above will match all the days after the January, 1st 2018.

  ```js
  const range = { 
    after: new Date(2020, 5, 20), 
    before: new Date(2020, 5, 30), 
  }
  ```

  The code above will match all the days between the 30th and the 20th of April 2018.

- **an object with a `daysOfWeek` array**, to match specific days of week:

  ```js
  const weekends = { 
    daysOfWeek: [0, 6],
  }
  ```

  will match all the Sundays (`0`) and Saturdays (`6`)

- **a function** taking the day as first argument and return a boolean value. For example:
  
  ```js
  function sundays(day) {
    return day.getDay() === 0;
  }
  function isFirstOfMonth(day) {
    return day.getDate() === 1;
  }
  ```
  are all valid modifiers.

- **an array of the above** 

## Examples

A CSS modifier is added to each day cell when a day matches a modifier. You set the day modifiers with the `selectedDay`, `disabledDays` or `modifiers` props. Examples:

* To add a `.DayPicker-Day--selected` CSS class to the February, 12th 2017 cell:

  ```jsx
  <DayPicker selectedDays={ new Date(2017, 1, 12) } />
  ```

* To add a `.DayPicker-Day--disabled` to the 4th and 7th of February 2017

  ```jsx
  <DayPicker disabledDays={ [new Date(2017, 2, 4), new Date(2017, 2, 7)] } />
  ```

* Beside `disabled` or `selected`, you can pass any modifier you prefer. For example, to set `.DayPicker-Day--past` to the days in the past:

  ```jsx
  <DayPicker 
    modifiers={ { 
      past: { before: new Date() } 
    } }
  />
  ```

* You pass more day modifiers using the `modifiers` prop:

  ```jsx
  <DayPicker 
    modifiers={ { 
      special: new Date(2018, 11, 11),
      
      booked: { 
        from: new Date(2017, 1, 11), 
        to: new Date(2017, 2, 23) 
      },
      
      holiday: [
        new Date(2018, 11, 25), 
        new Date(2018, 10, 31),
        { from: new Date(2018, 06, 10), to: new Date(2018, 06, 20) }
      ],

      sunday: { daysOfWeek: [0] }, 
      
      firstOfMonth: day => day.getDate() === 1,
    } }
  />
  ```

### Shortcuts for `selected` and `disabled` modifiers

Under the hood, the `selectedDays` and `disabledDays` props act as shortcut for the `selected` and a `disabled` modifiers. The following renders the same calendar:

```jsx
function isFirstOfMonth(day) {
  return day.getDate() === 1;
}

<DayPicker disabledDays={ sundays } selectedDays={ isFirstOfMonth } />

<DayPicker 
  modifiers={ { 
    disabled: { daysOfWeek: [0] }, 
    selected: isFirstOfMonth 
  }} 
/>
```

## Accessing modifiers from event handlers

Modifiers are passed as argument to the event handlers:

```jsx
function handleDayClick(day, modifiers) {
  if (modifiers.sundays) {
    console.log('Sunday has been clicked')
  }
}

function handleDayMouseEnter(day, { isFirstOfMonth, disabled }) {
  if (isFirstOfMonth) {
    console.log('The first day of month received mouse enter')
  }
  if (disabled) {
    console.log('This day is disabled')
  }
}

<DayPicker
  disabledDays={ new Date(2015, 0, 12) }
  modifiers={ { sundays, isFirstOfMonth } }
  onDayClick={ handleDayClick }
  onDayMouseEnter={ handleDayMouseEnter }
/>
```

### Use DateUtils to create modifiers

react-day-picker includes [DateUtils](utils-date.md), a small function library useful to simplify the creation of advanced modifiers.
