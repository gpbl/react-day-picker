## Basic Usage

To start using DayPicker,

1. Import the component and its default style from `react-day-picker`.
2. Choose a [selection mode](/using-daypicker/selection-modes) using the `mode` prop.
3. Assign the `selected` and `onSelect` props to manage the selected date.

### Example

```tsx title="App.jsx" caption="render:Start"
import "react-day-picker/style.css" // Import the default style
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker"

import { useState } from "react"

export function App() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState()

  return (
    <div role="application" aria-label="Date Picker">
      <DayPicker mode="single" selected={selected} onSelect={setSelected} />
    </div>
  )
}
