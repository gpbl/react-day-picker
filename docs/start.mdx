_Introduction_

# Installation

DayPicker is available as `react-day-picker` npm package. It requires [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) as a peer dependency.

<Callout>
  There's an [ongoing
  discussion](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/discussions/1087) to
  support other date libraries.
</Callout>

## Install from npm

```sh
$ npm install react-day-picker date-fns
```

## Basic Usage

To start using DayPicker, import the `<DayPicker />` component and its default style. Assign the `selected` and `onSelect` props to manage the selected date.

```tsx title="App.jsx" caption="render:Start"
import "react-day-picker/style.css"; // Import the default style
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

import { useState } from "react";

export function App() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState();

  return (
    <div role="application" aria-label="Date Picker">
      <DayPicker mode="single" selected={selected} onSelect={setSelected} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
