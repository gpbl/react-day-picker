_Introduction_

# Getting Started

DayPicker is available as `react-day-picker` npm package. It requires [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) as a peer dependency.

## Install from npm

```sh
$ npm install react-day-picker date-fns
```

- See #1087 if you are interested in DayPicker supporting different date
  libraries.

## Basic Usage

To create a simple date picker calendar,

1. Import the component and its default style from `react-day-picker`.
2. Choose a [selection mode](/using-daypicker/selection-modes) using the `mode` prop.
3. Assign the `selected` and `onSelect` props to manage the selected date.

```tsx title="App.jsx" caption="render:Start"
import "react-day-picker/style.css"; // Import the default style
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

import { useState } from "react";

export function App() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState();

  return <DayPicker mode="single" selected={selected} onSelect={setSelected} />;
}
```
