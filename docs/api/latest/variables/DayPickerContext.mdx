# Variable: DayPickerContext

> **`const`** **DayPickerContext**: `Context`\<`undefined` \| [`DayPickerContextValue`](/api/latest/interfaces/DayPickerContextValue.mdx)\>

The DayPicker context shares the props passed to DayPicker within internal
and custom components. It is used to set the default values and perform
one-time calculations required to render the days.

Access to this context from the [useDayPicker](/api/latest/functions/useDayPicker.mdx) hook.
