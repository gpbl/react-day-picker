# Calendar Options

> Change how months, weeks and days are displayed in the calendar.

## Outside Days

Outside days are the days from the previous and next months displayed in the month. Use `showOutsideDays` to display them.

```tsx caption="render:OutsideDays"
<DayPicker showOutsideDays />
```

## Extra Weeks

Use `fixedWeeks` to display six weeks per months. This will prevent the calendar
to change its height when navigating.

```tsx caption="render:FixedWeeks"
<DayPicker fixedWeeks />
```

## Week Numbers

Use `showWeeknumber` to display the week numbers. When this prop is set, use
`onWeeknumberClick` to handle the click on a week number.

```tsx caption="render:Weeknumber"
<DayPicker
  showWeekNumber
  onWeekNumberClick={(weekNumber) => {
    console.log(weekNumber);
  }}
/>
```
