# Calendar Options

---

## Outside Days

Outside days are the days from the previous and next months displayed in the month. Use `showOutsideDays` to display them.

<PreviewBox preview={<Examples.OutsideDays />}>
  ```tsx
  <DayPicker showOutsideDays />
  ```
</PreviewBox>

## Fixed Weeks

Use `fixedWeeks` to display six weeks per months. This will prevent the calendar
to change its height when navigating.

<PreviewBox preview={<Examples.FixedWeeks />}>
  ```tsx
  <DayPicker fixedWeeks />
  ```
</PreviewBox>

## Week Numbers

Use `showWeeknumber` to display the week numbers. When this prop is set, use
`onWeeknumberClick` to handle the click on a week number.

<PreviewBox preview={<Examples.Weeknumber />}>
  ```tsx
  <DayPicker
    showWeekNumber
    onWeekNumberClick={(weekNumber) => {
      console.log(weekNumber);
    }}
  />
  ```
</PreviewBox>
