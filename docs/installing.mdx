_Getting Started_

# Installing DayPicker

## Install from npm

DayPicker is available as an npm package and requires [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) as a peer dependency.

```sh
npm install react-day-picker date-fns
```

## Basic Usage

- To use DayPicker, import the `<DayPicker />` component and its default style.
- Use the `mode` prop to enable the [selection mode](./selecting-days).

```tsx title="App.jsx" caption="render:Start"
import "react-day-picker/style.css"; // Import the default style
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

import { useState } from "react";

export function App() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState();

  return (
    <div role="application" aria-label="Date Picker">
      <DayPicker mode="single" selected={selected} onSelect={setSelected} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
