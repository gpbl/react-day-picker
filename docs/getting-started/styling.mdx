# Styling

> Change the appearance of the HTML elements, such as headings, grid cells and buttons.

## Default Style

DayPicker comes with a minimal style inspired by MacOS date pickers and it's designed to be easily customized.

To start with the included style, import `react-day-picker/style.css` into your app. This will add the `.rdp` class names used by DayPicker.

### Using a React framework

If you are using a React framework, such as [Next.js](http://nextjs.org) or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), or a bundler like Webpack with [css-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/), import the CSS file from your app's main JavaScript or TypeScript file:

```tsx title="app.jsx"
import "react-day-picker/style.css";
```

### From a CDN

If you are using a CDN, add the following link to your HTML file:

```html title="index.html"
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/react-day-picker/style.css" />
```

### Usage with CSS Modules

When using CSS modules, you can import `style.module.css`. Pass the class names to the `classNames` prop.

```tsx title="MyComponent.jsx"
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";
import dayPickerClassNames from "react-day-picker/style.module.css";
// ...
<DayPicker classNames={dayPickerClassNames} />;
```

From here, you have different options to customize the appearance of the calendar, depending on your project setup.

## Using the `rdp-` CSS Variables

The default styles use CSS variables to make it easier to customize the base appearance of the calendar. You can override the CSS variables to change the appearance of the calendar.

```css title="global.css"
:root {
  --rdp-accent-color: indigo;
  --rdp-background-color: gray;
}
```

The following table lists the CSS variables used by DayPicker:

## Overriding the Style via CSS

To further customize the styles, override the DayPicker CSS. For example, to change the background color of the day cells, add this style sheet to your `global.css` or `app.css`.

```css title="global.css"
/* Change the background color of the day cell. */
.rdp-day {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

## Integration with Tailwind CSS

> TODO: this section is still incomplete.

```tsx filename="App.tsx" {4}
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";
import "react-day-picker/style.css";

import "./App.css"; // Import your custom styles to override the default CSS

function App() {
  return <DayPicker />;
}
```

## Basic Inline Styles Support

To change the appearance of any DayPicker element via inline-styles use the `styles` prop.

Using inline styles won't override the default class names. Mouse hover effects cannot be styled inline.

```tsx
const monthCaptionStyle = {
  borderBottom: "1px solid currentColor",
  paddingBottom: "0.5em",
};
// ...
<DayPicker
  styles={{
    month_caption: monthCaptionStyle,
  }}
/>;
```
