# Getting Started

1. Add `react-day-picker` and [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) to your dependencies:

```bash
npm install react-day-picker date-fns   # with npm
pnpm install react-day-picker date-fns  # with pnpm
yarn add react-day-picker date-fns      # with yarn
```

2. When importing, include the DayPicker CSS in your component:

function Component() {
  return <DayPicker />;
}
```
