# Selection Modes

DayPicker supports 3 built-in selection modes, that fit the most common use-cases for a date picker:

- **single mode**: only one day can be selected;
- **multi mode**: allow selection of multiple days;
- **range mode**: allow the selection of a range of days.

You can also implement your own selection logic by setting up a **custom selection mode**.

### Entering a Selection Mode

- To use the built-in modes, use the `mode` prop.
- To set a custom selection mode, use the `modifiers` and the `onDayClick` prop.

```tsx
// Enter the single selection mode
<DayPicker mode="single" selected={/*...*/} onSelect={/*...*/} />

// Enter the multi selection mode
<DayPicker mode="multi"  selected={/*...*/} onSelect={/*...*/} />

// Enter the range selection mode
<DayPicker mode="range" selected={/*...*/} onSelect={/*...*/} />

// Enter a custom selection mode
<DayPicker modifiers={{ selected: /*...*/ }} onDayClick={/*...*/} />
```

## Single Selection Mode

When using `mode="single"{:tsx}`, users can select only one day from the calendar:

```include-example filename="Single.tsx"

```

### Making a Selection Required

To make a selection required, use the `required` prop. Setting this prop won't
allow the user to unselect the selected day.

<Callout emoji="📝 " type="info">
  **Note about typings**: when `required` is set, the `selected` and `onSelect`
  props will still allow undefined values.
</Callout>

```include-example filename="SingleRequired.tsx"

```

## Selecting Multiple Days

Use `mode="multiple"{:tsx}` to allow the selection of multiple days:

```include-example filename="Multiple.tsx"

```

### Limiting the Selectable Days

Use `required` or the `min` and `max` props to limit the amount of days that can be selected.

```include-example filename="MultipleMinMax.tsx"

```

## Selecting a Range of days

Use `mode="range"{:tsx}` and `onSelect` to allow the selection of multiple days.

```include-example filename="Range.tsx"

```

### Limiting the range size

Use the `min` and `max` props to limit the amount of days in the range.

```include-example filename="RangeMinMax.tsx"

```

## Custom Selections

If the built-in selections mode doesn't fit your application's requirements, implement custom selections as explained in the [Custom Selections](/guides/custom-selections) advanced guide.
