# Customize DayPicker

Change months, weeks and days in the calendar.

## Showing the Outside Days

Use `showOutsideDays` to display the days falling out the current month.

```include-example filename="OutsideDays.tsx"

```

## Render Multiple Months

Use `numberOfMonths` to render more than one calendar.

```include-example filename="MultipleMonths.tsx"

```

Toggle `pagedNavigation` to navigate the number of months per time.

```include-example filename="MultipleMonthsPaged.tsx"

```

## Using Fixed Weeks

Use `fixedWeeks` to display six weeks per months. This will prevent the calendar
to change its height when navigating.

```include-example filename="Fixedweeks.tsx"

```

## Show the Week Numbers

Use `showWeeknumber` to display the week numbers. When this prop is set, use
`onWeeknumberClick` to handle the click on a week number.

```include-example filename="Weeknumber.tsx"

```

### Customize the Week Numbers

- To set the first day of the week, use `weekStartsOn`.
- To set the day of January in the first week of the year
  `firstWeekContainsDate`.
- Use the `formatWeeknumber` formatter to change how week numbers are displayed.

```include-example filename="WeeknumberCustom.tsx"

```

## Switch to ISO Week Dates

DayPicker uses [date-fns getWeek](https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeek) to
calculate the week number. By default, the week starts on Sunday and the first
week of the year is the one that contains January 1st. Use `ISOWeek` to switch
using [ISO Week Dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) instead of
the locale setting.

```include-example filename="WeeknumberIso.tsx"

```
