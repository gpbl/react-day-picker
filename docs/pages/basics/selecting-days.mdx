# Selecting Days

DayPicker supports 3 built-in selection modes:

- **Single mode**: only a single day can be selected. This is the default selection mode.
- **Multi mode**: allow selection of multiple days. Set `mode="multi"` to toggle multi mode.
- **Range mode** `mode="range"`: allow the selection of range of days. Set `mode="range"` to toggle range mode.
- You can also implement a **custom selection mode** using the `onDayClick` props.

To enable the built-in selections, you must use the `onSelect` prop and pass the selected days to the `selected` prop.

## Single Selections

<SourceCode source="single.tsx" />

<RenderingBox>
  <Single />
</RenderingBox>

### Making a selection required

To make a selection required, use `selected` with `required`. For example, to set the default selected date to today:

<SourceCode source="single-required.tsx" />

<RenderingBox>
  <SingleRequired />
</RenderingBox>

## Selecting Multiple Days

Use `mode="multiple"` to allow the selection of multiple days:

<SourceCode source="multiple.tsx" />

<RenderingBox>
  <Multiple />
</RenderingBox>

### Limiting the selectable days

Use the `min` and `max` props to limit the amount of days that can be selected.

<SourceCode source="multiple-min-max.tsx" />

<RenderingBox>
  <MultipleMinMax />
</RenderingBox>

## Selecting a Range of days

Use `mode="range"` and `onSelect` to allow the selection of multiple days.

```include-example
range
```

### Limiting the range size

Use the `min` and `max` props to limit the amount of days in the range.

```include-example
range-min-max
```

## Custom Selections

If the built-in selection modes are not enough for your appâ€™s requirements, you can control the selection behavior using `onDayClick`.

For example, to implement the "single selection" behavior (like when ``):

<SourceCode source="single.tsx" />

<RenderingBox>
  <Single />
</RenderingBox>

### Example: custom multiple select

The case of a multi-days select is a bit more complex as it deals with an array. The following example replicates the `mode="multiple"`
selection mode.

<SourceCode source="custom-multiple.tsx" />

<RenderingBox>
  <CustomMultiple />
</RenderingBox>
