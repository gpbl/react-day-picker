# Months Navigation

Configure how users can navigate between months.

## Change the Default Month

DayPicker displays the month of the current day. To change the
default month, set the `defaultMonth` prop.

For example, to set the default month to September 1979:

```include-example filename="DefaultMonth.tsx"

```

## Controlling the Current Month

DayPicker controls the displayed month and stores it in its internal state. To
control the current month – for example, to implement a "Go to today" button –
set the month in the parent component’s state.

To control the current month, use `month` (as opposed to `defaultMonth`) and
`onMonthChange` to handle the current month.

```include-example filename="Controlled.tsx"

```

## Limiting the Month Navigation

As default, DayPicker can navigate indefinitely in the past or in the future. To limit the navigable months between two years, use `fromYear` or `toYear`.

```include-example filename="FromToYear.tsx"

```

### Navigating Between Months or Dates

You can also limit the navigation with `fromDate`/`toDate` and `fromMonth` and
`toMonth`. For example, to limit the calendar between June 2015 and the 20th
Nov, 2015:

```include-example filename="FromToMonth.tsx"

```

## Choosing a Caption Layout

When limiting the navigable months, use `captionLayout="dropdown"` to display a drop-down
(a select HTML element) for navigating between months – instead of the previous
/ next buttons.

```include-example filename="Dropdown.tsx"

```

Use `captionLayout="dropdown-buttons"` to display both.

```include-example filename="DropdownButtons.tsx"

```

## Disabling Navigation

To disable the navigation between months, use `disableNavigation`.

```include-example filename="DisableNavigation.tsx"

```
