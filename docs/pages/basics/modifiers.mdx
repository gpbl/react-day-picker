Use Day Modifiers to change the appearance of the days in the calendar, or to
inspect the days the user has interacted with.

## Understanding Modifiers

In DayPicker, a **Modifier** is added to a day when it matches a specific
condition. For example, selected days get a `selected` modifier; disabled days
get a `disabled` modifier; the today's date uses the `today` modifier, etc.

DayPicker comes with some built-in modifiers (`disabled`, `selected`, `hidden`,
`today`, etc.). You can add your own modifiers too: for example, a date picker
to book some hotel reservations may implement a `already-booked` custom
modifier, to display them as "already booked".

## The `selected` Modifier

When in [selection mode](/basics/selection-modes), use the `selected` prop to
add the `selected` modifier to the selected dates, and style them accordingly.

Inspect the day the user has clicked using the `onSelect` callback.

```include-example filename="ModifiersSelected.tsx"

```

## The `disabled` Modifier

When in selection mode, use the `disabled` modifier to disable one or more days.
Pass a [`Matcher`](/api/types/matcher) or an array of `Matchers` to choose the
disabled days:

```include-example filename="ModifiersDisabled.tsx"

```

## The `hidden` Modifier

The `hidden` modifier removes the day from the calendar. Set the hidden days
using the `hidden` prop.

```include-example filename="ModifiersHidden.tsx"

```

## The `today` modifier

The `today` modifier is added to the current date. You can change the current
date using the `today` prop.

```include-example filename="ModifiersToday.tsx"

```

## Custom modifiers

Add new modifiers according to your appâ€™s requirements. For example, a booking
app may use a `booked` modifier to mark days as already booked.

Use the `modifiers` prop to pass an object with custom modifiers and their
matcher. Change the inline-style of the cell with `modifiersStyles` or with
`modifiersClassNames`.

```include-example filename="ModifiersCustom.tsx"

```

## Styling modifiers

A day can be styled according to its modifiers â€“ using CSS or inline styles. See
[Styling DayPicker](/basics/styling) for more details.
