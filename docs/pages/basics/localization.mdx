# Localization

Learn to localize DayPicker in any language.

## Changing Locale

To change the locale, pass to the `locale` prop a date-fns [Locale
object](http://date-fns.org/docs/Locale).

For example, to localize the calendar in Spanish, import the locale object from
date-fns and pass it to the component:

```include-example filename="Spanish.tsx"

```

### Overriding the First Day of the Week

Use the `weekStartsOn` prop to change the first day of the week:

```include-example filename="SpanishWeekStartsOn.tsx"

```

### First Week of the Year

To override the date in the first week of the year, use `firstWeekContainsDate`.
Use this prop to change the week number calculation according to [date-fns
getWeek](https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeek) function.

```include-example filename="WeeknumberCustom.tsx"

```

## Switching to ISO Week Dates

By default, week numbers and week days follow the DayPicker's locale. Use the
`ISOWeek` prop to switch to [ISO week
dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).

```include-example filename="WeekIso.tsx"

```

## Translating ARIA labels

Use the [labels prop](/api/interfaces/daypickerdefaultprops#labels) to translate
the labels used for ARIA.

## Right-To-Left Direction

To add right-to-left text direction, set the `dir` prop to `rtl`.

```include-example filename="Rtl.tsx"

```

## Numbering System

Use [formatters](/guides/formatters) to change the [numbering system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system) used in the
calendar.

For example, to switch to hindu-arabic using
[toLocaleString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString):

```include-example filename="NumberingSystem.tsx"

```
