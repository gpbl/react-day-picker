The [DayPicker repository](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker) is setup with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). The project is a monorepo containing two workspaces:

- `react-day-picker` (the root workspace): contains the [source code](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/next/src) and the development tools.
- `docs`: a [Nextra app](http://nextra.site) used for [the documentation website](http://react-day-picker.js.org).

## Prerequisites

To work with the source code, you must have good knowledge of TypeScript, React and the related Node.js ecosystem. We run our unit tests with `jest`.

### Requirements

- Node 18.16+. To set the version via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) run the command `nvm use{:sh}`:
- pnpm 8+. To enable pnpm in Node, make sure `corepack` is enabled via `corepack enable{:sh}` command.

### Setting up the repository

Clone the monorepo and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:gpbl/react-day-picker.git
cd react-day-picker
pnpm
```

If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), open the [react-day-picker.code-workspace](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/main/react-day-picker.code-workspace) with for the development environment.
