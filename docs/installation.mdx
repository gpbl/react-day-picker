_Getting Started_

# Installing

Get DayPicker from npm. Requires [React 18+](https://react.dev) and [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/).

<Steps>

### Install from npm

Run `npm install` to add DayPicker to your package.json:

```bash
npm install react-day-picker date-fns --save
```

### Import the Base Style

Import the CSS file from the package into your application.

```jsx title="app.js"
import "react-day-picker/style.css";
```

### Implement your first date picker

Now you can use the `DayPicker` component in your application:

```jsx title="app.js"
import { useState } from "react";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

export default function App() {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(new Date());
  return <DayPicker selected={selectedDate} onSelected={setSelectedDate} />;
}
```

</Steps>
