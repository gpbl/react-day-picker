# Roadmap

## Current Goals

### Improving accessibility

For improved screen reader support, the HTML structure and ARIA attributes will be updated in v9. This is likely to break existing custom styles and unit tests.

- See the [list of accessibility issues](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3Av9.0.0).

### Faster build

In a future version we will remove the need to build DayPicker with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and use the TypeScript compiler.

## v9

The next major version of DayPicker is currently in development. The main goals are:

- **Improved Accessibility**
- **Easier Styling** -
- **Improved selection modes** - e.g. fixed issues with
- **Improved custom components**
- **Improved TypeScript support**
- **Better performances**

### Improved Accessibility

### Easier Styling

Version 9 will include a new CSS architecture to make it easier to customize DayPicker styles, especially when using the popular tailwind.css framework.

- The built-in CSS requires a lot of work for proper customization. As it implements many pseudo-selectors such as `:disabled` or `:focus`, the CSS cascade creates additional difficulties when targeting DayPicker element styles. Version 9 will reduce the number of pseudo-selectors and improve the use of CSS variables for an easier customization.
- Version 9 will also improve TypeScript support for the UI elements, providing more consistent and well-documented naming for CSS classes.
