## Upgrading from v7

### How to upgrade to v8

1. **Upgrade the dependency**. DayPicker now has [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) as peer dependency.
   ```bash
   npm install react-day-picker@latest date-fns
   ```
2. **Remove the types package**, if you were using it:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall @types/react-day-picker
   ```
3. **Update the CSS import**: the stylesheet has been moved to `/dist`. For example:
   ```diff
   - import `react-day-picker/lib/style.css`
   + import `react-day-picker/dist/style.css`
   ```
4. **Update your custom styles**. See [Styling DayPicker](/basics/styling) for more information.
5. **Update the changed props**. See the list below.
6. **Replace `DateUtils` with date-fns**. Use [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) instead of [DateUtils](https://react-day-picker-v7.netlify.app/api/DateUtils) to handle dates.
   - Replace `addDayToRange` with [addToRange](/api/functions/addToRange), which is still exported in v8

### Updated Props

- `showWeekNumbers` has been renamed to `showWeekNumber`
- `todayButton` has been removed. See [Controlling the current month](/basics/navigation#controlling-the-current-month) for an example implementing the same feature.
- `initialMonth` has been renamed to `defaultMonth`. See [Navigating months](/basics/navigation) for more details about using `month` and `defaultMonth`.
- `canChangeMonth` has been renamed to `disableNavigation`
- `selectedDays` has been renamed to `selected`. See also: [Selecting Days guide](/basics/selecting-days).
- `disabledDays` has been renamed to `disabled`. See also: [Disabling days](/basics/modifiers#disabling-days).

## ISO weeks

This version use the locale setting to calculate the week days and numbers. The previous versions were using [ISO week dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date). To toggle the ISO week dates, use the `ISOWeek` prop.

## DayPickerInput

The `DayPickerInput` component has been removed. If you upgrade to v8, you will need to rewrite your implementation:

- Try with [useInput](/guides/input-fields) hook.
- See [this example](/guides/input-fields#example-date-picker-dialog) to build a date picker with v8 in a dialog.
