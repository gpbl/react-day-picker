/**
 * React currently throws a warning when using useLayoutEffect on the server. To
 * get around it, we can conditionally useEffect on the server (no-op) and
 * useLayoutEffect in the browser. We occasionally need useLayoutEffect to
 * ensure we don't get a render flash for certain operations, but we may also
 * need affected components to render on the server. One example is when setting
 * a component's descendants to retrieve their index values.
 *
 * Important to note that using this hook as an escape hatch will break the
 * eslint dependency warnings unless you rename the import to `useLayoutEffect`.
 * Use sparingly only when the effect won't effect the rendered HTML to avoid
 * any server/client mismatch.
 *
 * If a useLayoutEffect is needed and the result would create a mismatch, it's
 * likely that the component in question shouldn't be rendered on the server at
 * all, so a better approach would be to lazily render those in a parent
 * component after client-side hydration.
